t3_n2kuuq,Stuck in bad habits for years and I realized it has to do with my environment. Anybody changed their environment/city and experienced profound change?,gwkiiie,"Using new environments as a way to create healthy habits for yourself has been a great tool for me. Sometimes (especially when I was a student and low on $$) it even helped to move around furniture to give off the impression of being in a new place. It gives me the momentum to try something new and leave the ""old"" lifestyle behind. Give yourself the opportunity to try new things (hobbies, reading materials, philosophy). In some cities I've tried ""sporty"" versions of myself, others ""arts &amp; music"" version. Something will click eventually :) the trick is to immerse yourself completely and don't let that ""this isn't me"" thought get in the way.",651
t3_n2ooiu,Should I be insecure of my penis size?,gwkpxm5,"Truth is, the vast majority of women can't orgasm from penetration alone. The clitoris is the important bit- it has the most nerve endings of any one spot of the human body, and is the same tissue that develops into the penis in a male. Simply put, that's our real pleasure spot, and pretty much everyone is equally equipped to please it if you're willing to learn how. I'm not saying penetration doesn't help, it certainly does, just that your penis size probably isn't going to make or break a woman's sexual experience with you, especially not if it's just average. Seriously, there's nothing wrong with being average- it's kind of the point that most men are equipped about where you're at. Porn tends to only show you the really big stuff, so I'm sure if I was a guy I'd feel insecure about being average too, but I promise there's nothing wrong with you.",860

My monthly page this month actually has trackers and whatnot, so I put that all together today and started next week’s weekly. If I like the monthly tracker, I’ll just keep with what I’ve been doing - stick it on whatever page comes next when the month ticks over and keep using the current weekly page.",418

t3_n2x0xk,ELI5: Are photons physical particles? As in could I grab one out of the air and hold it?,gwm6fz5,"Photons are... weird. The short answers to your questions are: yes, they're physical particles; no, you couldn't grab one out of the air or hold it. Photons have no *inertial mass*, so they're not made out of ""stuff"" in the sense we traditionally think of it. They're really packets of energy. But energy is basically the same thing as mass for... reasons... so they still react to other matter in ways that mass does. Which is why they can be reflected (mirrors) or refracted (look at a straw in a glass of water).",515
t3_n2xr6w,"For people who always forget their dreams, what is a dream that you will forever remember?",gwmaczg,"this is kinda disturbing but I will never forget it when I was 9-10 I had these dreams for a week where I would go to a waterpark with a bunch of adults and the water was all just blood. Everyone would gather around the large slide to watch each day one guy go down it and he would be blended into a blood smoothie at the end and everyone would drink the guys blood. It was like a ceremony. Eventually it came to the point where it was my turn to go down the slide and I was crying and saying that I “wasnt worthy” to be a blood smoothie yet. And one guy said “yes, you are” and pushed me down. Before I got blended I woke up. And, I never had that dream again. I have no idea why my young mind dreamt this up and I never told anyone about these dreams at the time. It wasnt scary to me when I was that age but looking back it was incredibly disgusting.",853

Like anything from teen slasher type stuff? situations where it seems that random chance absolutely fucks you and you have to survive any way you know how? Are there actually murderous cannibal rednecks in the woods?,gwmand0,"Idk if this counts, but my parents told me that as a baby I some how managed to craw out of the house few feet’s away from the building at around 8pm and my mom freaked out. She had trusted my older sibling to hold me while she was making dinner. That terrified me when I heard what happened.

t3_n2y20t,"What have important thinkers throughout history defined as the difference between humans and other animals? Who had specific ideas on this, and what were the core ideas in layman's terms?",gwmvpov,"Descartes believed that animals were “meaty automata” with no souls/minds or experience of the world and reacted only to external stimuli, whereas he thought humans had souls/minds that could interact with our bodies. Chomsky thinks that the language capacity is a relatively recent evolutionary adaption that is unique to humans. There’s likely more but those are two I can think of off the top of my head.",407
t3_n2xpm3,ELI5: How do analog signals (magnetic tape in particular) work?,gwmd5zf,"It’s varying levels. Think of a photograph on film, which is functionally infinite resolution as far as human eyeballs are concerned (you can’t see any pixels). With magnetic tape, you feed a varying electric signal to the write-head of the tape recorder and it “writes” an equivalent magnetic field to the tape. When you run that same tape past a read-head later, the magnetic field of the tape re-creates the same electric signal (after amplification). There’s actually no difference between analog and digital here...all tapes are physically analog. It’s just a matter of how the reading machine interprets the electrical signal. If the electrical signal coming out is a copy of what came from, say, a TV camera, then you feed that output signal to a TV, then you recreate the image the camera saw.",801
t3_n2yab2,Is It Selfish To Not Want A Birthday/Graduation Party Even If Your Friends Might Like To?,gwmdk91,"it's completely fine and normal, I dont like parties for me either. (I'm also ok with going to others parties) personally why I dont like them is because of too much attention on me makes me feel incredibly anxious and drained, so it's completely normal to not want a party. if you dont want one you shouldnt feel obligated to have one.",336
t3_n2ybtr,What was your ‘ah ha’ moment that finally made you grow up ?,gwmflms,"My friends show love differently than I do. I felt so lonely for so long. I’ve been seriously burned by a best friend and for a while (kinda still am) I was super sensitive that my friends actually didn’t like me and would betray me just as easily as my best friend did in the past. Then, that saying clicked and suddenly I’m overwhelmed with my friends’ love. Some like physical touch and recognizing that those hugs when I arrive and leave are them showing they love me means more. Some friends it’s quality time so when we’re just sitting together watching terrible TV and laughing, I feel loved. Some it’s gifts so when it’s my birthday and I get a gift card and hand written card, I feel loved. It’s crazy to me how what seems like a slight change of mindset changes my own feelings, yet, for me, it worked. Not perfectly. I still grapple with worries of the fragility of these friendships but I’m getting better every time I recognize their form of love.",960

t3_n2ysf0,"Being careful to avoid spoilers, what is the BEST ending to a movie, book, or series that you've come across?",gwmgkpk,"Fight Club by far has the absolute best ending of a movie or book but for different reasons; the movie depicts the woes of consumerism while revelling in its inherently capitalist medium and creates an ambient and perfect movie with strong characters. The book offers a deeper philosophical look into toxic masculinity and the temptation of nihilism in young adulthood/teens. The absolute perfect mindfuck I promise, it will have you guessing if you don't know it. Greatest book or movie of all time.",500
t3_n2zd06,"To Architects, How Much Math Is Required In Your Job?",gwmjt33,"For Context: I'm a Year 11 Student (16 y.o) having to choose A-Level subjects, I originally wanted to become an illustrator but my parents said they would not support me financially if I chose to. Rather they are opting for me to learn Architecture. They are both engineers and claim that they can help me, though they couldn't even help with my O-Level homework. My worry is that I've recently dropped off in math (previously being an A-B student), at best I can get a B, at worse I can get Ds;; I understand that's not necessarily an F, but I really wish to excel at what I do; I'm anxious to take A-Level mathematics so any insight on that would be help as well.

t3_n2ziu4,What’s touristy thing have you been so excited to see but it was a total let down?,gwmo6sr,"Not a *total* let down, but they don't let you REALLY get in and explore the ruins at Chichén Itzá, you pretty much stay on a path and walk through the temples they've reconstructed and point out the piles of rubble where more used to be. It was still worth seeing and a great trip, I just really wanted to climb the temples and experience the views the ancient Mayans would have had. It's understandable why they don't, though...people are scum and would probably trash the place",480
t3_n3jxbv,"ELI5: How is Wi-Fi ""shared"" to multiple devices?",gwq9tlj,"When a device ""talks"" to your router, what it's doing is, in a kind of way, ""flashing"" a light on and off that the router can ""see"". This light is pretty dim so it can only be seen clearly a few dozen meters or so away. It can penetrate through some walls but maybe only one or two before it gets really hard to see. Your wireless router is a bit like your own eyes in the sense that it can pick up a small range of different light frequencies. That is, it can ""see"" a few different ""colors"". When a device tries to connect to your Wi-Fi router, it will sit back and look at everyone else in the room and see which colors they're flashing in. Then, it will try to pick a color that is different from everyone else, and flash in that color. Your router should be able to see all the different flashing colors at the same time, and it's able to tell them all apart because it can separate out the colors. This can break down if you have too many devices, however. Like, two devices might be trying to flash in colors that are very close shades to one another. If you mix it with poor signal quality that can distort the colors, the router might get confused when the two devices try to talk at the same time, and it might ask them to repeat themselves. This is one way a router can ""slow down"" when too many people connect. In general, your router can maybe handle four or five devices ""talking"" at the same time before the colors start to collide with each other.",1462

The next is knowing what you have to change to do it, and looking deep into yourself. It's not easy and it can take years.to do. And from there you do what you have to do. Work out, meditate, eat better, or even seek therapy. Whatever you need to do to become the best virsion of yourself is up to you.",376

t3_n409it,ELI5 How do fans make a room cooler if all it does is move the same temperature air from point A to point B?,gwssoe2,"What the ceiling fan does is promote a certain kind of heat transfer known as convection. Convection is a combination of two other different forms of heat transfer Conduction and advection. Conduction is simply heat transfer through molecular vibration. When a solid body is heated up, molecules close to the source of the heat vibrate, which in turn causes the molecules immediately adjacent to them to vibrate and so on thereby transferring the energy. Conductive heat transfer is therefore dominant in solids where the molecules are closely packed together thus facilitating this intimate exchange of energy. Gases and liquids simply have too much intermolecular space which prevents them from conducting heat efficiently. Advection is heat transfer through the bulk motion of a fluid (liquid or gas). While queiscent fluids are in general poor conductors, flowing fluids can simply carry away the energetic molecules from a surface thereby facilitating the heat transfer. Now the rate at which a body cools down through conduction or advection is proportional to the temperature gradient or more simply the temperature difference between the hot body and the cold coolant. Under ordinary circumstances, if you were to enter a room where the ceiling fan was turned off, your body would lose heat by two primary methods, radiation and conduction. Now unless you were wearing your birthday suit very little of your skin would be exposed to faciliatate radiative heat transfer. That leaves only conduction. Now the molecules of your skin in contact with the still air in the room will transfer heat to the air molecules by conduction. However, as mentioned, before, gases are very poor heat conductors. As a result, only a thin layer of air in immediate contact with your bare skin heats up, and as it does so the temperature gradient between it and your body decreases. As a result the rate of heat transfer slows down and because you are no longer losing heat you start to feel warm. Now you switch on the fan. Immediately the air molecules next to your skin are pushed away and replaced by new molecules which are at a much lower temprature (remember only the air in immediate contact with you was heated, the rest of the room would have remained at a lower temperature). as a result, the all important temperature difference between you and the rest of the room is being maintained. (The air in the room heats up of course, but it is a lot of air and the average temperature remais relatively low) And you have the conditions necessary for convective heat transfer. You conduct the heat to the air molecules nearest to your body and they are advected away by the fan. In fact, the original law of convective cooling was stated by Newton precisely in terms of moving air, thusly: “The rate of heat loss of a body is proportional to the difference in temperatures between the body and its surroundings while under the effects of a breeze.” Fans also promote evaporation of liquids from your skin (in fact sweating is your body’s natural reaction to improve heat transfer to your surroundings and to cool you down) which also improves heat transfer. The transition from liquid to gas which occurs in evaporation requires energy and this energy is obtained from your body. As a result you lose heat and cool down. In short therefore, fans promote the heat transfer between hot bodies and their immediate surroundings. This is why I take issue with people who say fans do not cool anything. Its true, they do not lower the overall temperature of a room, but they do promote the transfer of heat and that is cooling as well.",3622
t3_n43q67,"What job/career path do you think people should know about, but most people are unaware of?",gwti5c9,"Teaching English overseas. I know most people are aware of this job, but a lot of people are surprised just how easy it is to start. The requirements for most of the jobs are: 1. Be a native English speaker (or a very competent non-native speaker) 2. Any college degree 3. A certificate that takes 1 month to earn. And honestly, you can find jobs if you have 2/3 of those things, but they may not be the best. That's it. Most of the jobs provide you with housing and a middle-class salary for the country you're working in, meaning it can be very easy to save money. I bought a new car and covered all my living expenses during graduate school with what I saved working for 2 years abroad, and I didn't even try to save money (went out 1-2 times a week, travelled 1-2 times per year, ate out 3-4 nights per week).",813
t3_n46i7w,Why is my mom’s behavior so creepy?,gwtv7k5,"That is horrific, and uncalled for in the most extreme ways. I can't imagine telling my children they will be abused, or that they are unwanted, and I am even more unable to imagine what it would feel like. Your parents are horrid, and don't deserve to have children. If you are 18, you're mother can't control you, she has nothing. Try to find somewhere else. A friend, a different family member, even a shelter. Ive been in a shelter, it blows all manner of ass, but it's not the worst thing to happen, and they have a lot of help available for work and housing resources. If you are under 18 call CPS. Tell them everything. Sure, your mother maybe angry, but what hasn't she done already? They can help you get into a safer place, and keep an eye on you while you are with her to be sure it's okay. They will also look after your siblings if its needed. You mentioned class, I assume the school you are I will have a therapist or social worker you can talk with to help you sort out next steps and help calm your mind, no matter what age you are, do that. Contact someone who can help with your mind. Good luck, and try to remember that chances are your parents are sick, and untreated. Keep yourself safe, and distant. Do not feel bad about being angry, or upset. You deserved better, and got unlucky. Do not compare your situation to others, it doesn't lessen what you are going through, only makes you less likely to seek help. You are valid, and deserve to be heard.",1473

Any of the molecules your body uses or produces are recognized as “self” molecules. Any other molecules are therefore recognized as “non-self” molecules and your body has methods to dispose of them.

By cooking it you break down the hard to digest parts and you get more out of it while expending less resources in the process. This leaves more for other parts of your body.

Some funnels don't appreciably shrink downward: the EF4 that hit Greensburg KS was roughly evenly cylindrical all the way down. It has to do without how the air column is able to move the air and debris around it. As the funnel descends, it takes more and more energy to maintain it the farther from the cloud it extends, thus there is less kinetic energy - less air movement - at the bottom than the top.",442

t3_n4ahgc,ELI5: How does the sound barrier work? Why is there a transonic region that creates more drag than regions above and below?,gwufcs2,"The molecules in air (or any gas) are constantly whizzing around at high speed. They're actually going, basically, at the speed of sound all the time. But they're going in random directions and constantly bouncing off one another over relatively short distances. You feel this motion as pressure. If you try to move through air, the air molecules need to get out of the way. Since they're already going really fast that's pretty easy if you're going slowly. But as the speed you're going gets close to the speed \*they're\* going, it gets really hard for them to get out of the way fast enough. If you're going at the same speed as they are, they can't get out of the way and they pile up. That's a shockwave. Once you're going supersonic, a shockwave is the only way the air can change direction because it can't ""see"" the object coming...pressure in a fluid is transmitted at the speed of sound, if you're going faster than that the ""news"" that you're coming can't propogate upstream and the first time the air knows you've arrived is when the shockwave smacks into the air. Shockwaves involve a lot of energy dissipation (the air gets hotter), which is a source of drag. The faster you go, in general, the more drag because 1) you're pushing more air out of the way faster and 2) the shocks get stronger. Around transonic it gets really screwy because as you approach the speed of sound the flow on some parts of the vehicle will go supersonic before others. You end up with small shocks all over the place, which can interact with each other and the vehicle and generally totally screw up your streamlining because they flow directions get all out of whack. Streamlining for low speed is relatively easy. Streamlining for supersonic is repetitively easy. Streamlining for transsonic is a @!#%!@ mess, and super specific to the exact speed you're going. At anything other than the design speed, you're kind of screwed, so you generally get a big drag rise starting around M0.8 (ish) that goes away past about M1.2(ish). This is why most commercial jets live around M0.8-M0.9, and any particular one has an efficient range only 0.03 wide or so (the faster ones are using special tricks to delay some of the transsonic effects), and supercruising aircraft like F-22 run at M1.2+.",2280
t3_n4aorv,What was it like your first time sneaking out?,gwuhokt,"Not me, but my younger brother (16 at the time). He came home from a mate's house slightly tipsy and declared to me (but not our parents) that he was gonna climb through the kitchen window after everyone else was asleep, go back to his mate's, then come back at 5am just before dad gets up to start getting ready to work. I stupidly didn't immediately tell our parents when he told me, mainly because he tends to hold grudges, and I agreed to keep quiet if he kept me out of it if he got caught, I even assisted him in sneaking out by flushing the toilet to cover up the noise of him climbing out the window. The best part is that he made the incredibly ballsy move of not coming back that night, instead opting to stay at his mate's ALL NIGHT. Luckily for him dad didn't check our room when he got up to go to work, and when our mom got up later she just assumed he went out skateboarding early that day.

t3_n46cuy,ELI5: Why do some women experience more painful periods after giving birth?,gwuimdw,"When a woman ovulates about midway through her menstrual cycle, the uterus begins preparing for a possible pregnancy and the lining becomes thick and spongy. If no pregnancy occurs, that is expelled out through her regular monthly period. Pregnancy can change the uterus of to make it permanently larger, meaning more tissue and blood to expel every month. Pregnancy can also cause the lining to become permanently thicker, with the same result. Endometriosis (uterine tissue being found outside the uterus in the abdominal or pelvic cavity) can occur before or after pregnancy, and this uterine tissue will attempt to shed just like normal uterine tissue but has nowhere to go and is often located in places that have more nerve endings, causing more pain. Breastfeeding after delivery often (but not always) prevents menstruation. Birth control can also help with the issues but has unwanted side effects of its own.

I'm not expert movie man from king fuck mountain, but I've worked a lot of sets and it really depends on the people involved, and the kind of project. On a commercial, where lines are very specific, line deliveries aren't uncommon. In film, where dialogue is a bit more organic based on emotion, it's all about the comfort levels of the director and actor. An old acting coach of mine spoke about a moment on the set of A Few Good Men when Rob Reiner gave Jack Nicholson a line reading during the court scene and Nicholson just responded with, ""Oh... well I guess I'm just not there yet."" Some directors do 50 takes, some do 1 or 2, some micro-manage, some don't. No wrong answers, and everyone has their own comfort levels.",974

It’s just so bland and feels clunky to me, but the stories he tells are so cool that it makes up for that. I don’t like, look down on plain styles of writing... but I’ve found prose on Reddit that I liked better than his. I do not enjoy reading Ted Chiang’s stories, but I absolutely love thinking about and remembering his stories. (Maybe it would be good to add that the first book I read in English, in six years, was The Great Gatsby. So for awhile there, Fitzgerald’s writing was the bar for me. Immediately after I read Ted Chiang’s second collection of short stories.)",634

t3_n5lajb,"Instead of using Zoom, Google Classroom, or whatever else schools use online, schools are using discord. What's different and why?",gx1tt2u,"Discord is fairly cheap, allows for extra privacy in the fact that students don't have to show themselves on camera if they don't want, and because it is an established brand it is easier to get kids to adopt the use. Classroom is free, but requires extra signup processes and kids would have to download and sign in specially. Zoom has a free tier, but a school trying to host multiple classes over the course of a day with hundreds of students will exceed that limit and require a paid license. On top of the ease of adoption and the price concerns, there is just a lot that can be done on Discord. Students can be allowed in or out of classrooms based on their curriculum, can be given roles like teacher's assistant or tutor to allow them to help others, can quickly go into private messaging to allow for private or embarrassing questions and even use the Discord API to set up different activities, like science experiments.",930

Much of that stuff could be removed. But that by itself is a potentially dangerous process. What do you delete? Do you have definitive proof that it's safe to delete? Does the game have some step where every item that might ever be needed gets loaded just once to confirm it's working? Let's say you have some cars in your game and you decide to drop one of them from the random selection of cars driving around the city. Are you sure there isn't a storyline character who drives that car? You took the car out of the random rotation, but are you sure it's safe to delete the whole car's information from the game? A few such things slip through the cracks. In a huge project there could be a lot of such things that happen.

t3_n5lek3,IIL overblown bombs of movies like The God's Of Egypt WEWIL?,gx2knt7,"*Caligula* is like the UR overblown bomb movie, full of graphic nudity and sex that is somehow not titillating, and gigantic sets that were sometimes actually bigger than the real Roman palaces they were meant to depict. Also a baby was born live on screen in this movie! Nothing like this will ever be made again. A++++. *Legend* with Tom Cruise is a total mess, an excuse to indulge in a gorgeous-looking fantastical landscape and dreamy synth soundtrack. Huge plus for Tim Curry acting the shit out of his villain role while handfuls of glitter are flung into his face from offscreen. Rating: A+++. *Excalibur* is easily the least entertaining out of the three. You know a movie is doomed when half the cast is made up of the director's children. Anyway, this ponderous Arthurian saga has just enough bizarre elements to make it worthwhile -- why is Lancelot naked? Why is Arthur's mom doing a weird pussy popping dance?

I've also sold stories for publication. I've talked to multiple editors and am friends with some... a story isn't always turned down because the writing lacked something. There are times when the story is too similar to others the editor has read and perhaps purchased. Or perhaps it's just not to their taste in the same way that some well written books aren't to everyone's tastes. But I'm very certain I've been turned down numerous times because the quality wasn't as strong as other submissions. This is usually the reason - for me, at least. I've been given feedback at times that made the point clear, so it's not just conjecture. Most of the time, of course, there is never feedback because there is a high volume of submissions to any market and too little time for personal responses in most cases. And that's simply how things are. But regardless of why I've been turned down, you will also be turned down... for your own reasons that may be similar to mine. It can be for reasons that are both rational and irrational. But we must keep writing, improving our craft, and submitting. And submitting. And submitting. Getting turned down is what we authors all have in common - from the greatest of us to the least. Persistence is of the highest value to us... perhaps more so than even creativity itself.",1373

The Queen now moves only 3 spaces but can move a second time in the same turn, but her options for directions are limited during the second movement. (If she moves diagonally first she can only move file for the second move, conversely she can only move diagonally on the second love if she moves file for the first move. This means she can move in ""V"" or ""\_""shaped patterns.) She cannot move a second time if she takes a piece with the first move. Rooks: Rooks now crash into enemies with additional velocity, allowing them to hit enemies directly behind the target in the same direction. However, you cannot move the same rook two turns in a row making them vulnerable after attacking. King: Kings can now learn to fight, every time the king takes a piece his range increases by 1. Pawns: Pawns are now escape artists and can break free from the enemy prison with a bit of help. If a knight makes it to the 8th rank you can take back 1 of your missing pawns and place it anywhere in the 2nd rank. Bishops: Whenever a pawn gets promoted the bishops gets to make an additional move during the same turn. Knights: Unchanged because they are already the most crackhead piece.",1295

t3_n6uipd,ELI5: How did wheels work before we invented wheel bearings?,gx99igb,"Yes they relied on two surfaces rubbing together, and yes those surfaces were often greased. A lot (probably the majority) of rotating objects still rely on plain bearings with sliding contact like this. Regarding the resistance, note that the sliding surface is quite a small diameter, and cart wheels tend to be very large. This means that the sliding distance for a given travel distance is quite small, so the effective resistance is quite low. This also helps to reduce wear. Another solution to wear is to make one part sacrificial, often this is a bush or pillow block. This part is made of softer material than the other so wears faster. This can be replaced periodically, and reduces wear on the harder, retained part. Some woods (and plastics) are also self lubricating and so prized for this purpose. For example submarines are or were until recently made with lignum vitae shaft bearings.",900

t3_n819uo,"Taking advantage of other people’s ignorance is malevolent, is it not?",gxgoxi9,"I think you could phrase your question a little differently to get better answers. ""Taking advantage"" implies they are being abusive and shuts down the conversation. I think a better way to put it would be ""Is using someone's ignorance to get them to do something always malevolent"". Well, that's basically parenting. You're ordering a human around under the assumption that your experience is better for it because of their ignorance. I'd say that a line is crossed if you have an opportunity to give the human information that would allow them to make their own choice, but instead you withhold some information, and only provide the information that you feel will lead them to make the decision you feel is right. So essentially you're manipulating someone to make a specific choice instead of giving them the tools to make their own choice. I can provide an example. I had someone close to me whose car engine died. They didn't know much about cars and asked me for my help. My mechanic told me they could put in a new engine, but that it was basically the same price as buying a newer car of equal value. I personally, and my mechanic felt that buying a new engine was a waste of money. However, I gave the owner of the car their options. I gave my recommendation, but I didn't tell them that was their only option. They chose to replace the engine. If I had told them they needed a new car, that would have been manipulative and wrong. Also, it may have been the right choice for them. While I'm completely capable of shopping for a new car, they knew so little about cars, they may have gotten ripped off, and were more comfortable knowing a trusted mechanic would fix the car. So the ""right"" decision for you, isn't always the right decision for another person.",1769

I thought it was a headache, but as the plane kept descending, it began hurting more and more and more, to the point that I would have passed out had it gone on for a couple more minutes. Luckily, when the plane touched down, the pain quickly subsided. I realized I probably forgot to equalize my ears but the pain was so sudden and severe in the moment that was the last thing that could come to mind.",741

t3_n83xrv,ELI5: how tf do planes work??,gxgib87,"As someone who works in aviation, that is a very challenging question when answer must be understood even when explained to a kid. I would like to share what worked for me... Airfoil. Remember this term. It is the name of what is called shape of aircraft wings/propeller blade but we can focus with wings. Flat bottom, curved top. Just like your hand, try to imagine. Form your hand like floor flattened, that’s an airfoil. Not sure if everyone experienced this but extra caution and adult guidance is needed if to be done - riding as a passenger in a vehicle with windows open. While traveling, I extended my arm outside the window and formed my hand floor flattened as if it was a plane with matching swoosh sound effect (to boost imagination). Floor flattened hand form is pointed forward, same direction travel of the vehicle I am in. This is where the magic starts to happen. Try to point your hand a little bit upwards. You will see (and feel) that your hand begins to float or continuously move up with less effort from your arm. The air that passes below your hand helps to push your palm up. Just like vehicles, planes do also have engine to accelerate and move forward but since planes has wings (in the shape of an airfoil which we demonstrated like your arm), the upward movement is possible/enabled which is called “lift”, hence, how planes fly. Note: Theories/four forces and other science/engineering references intended not included to avoid confusion and debate.

t3_n97esy,ELI5: What is an Eigenvalue and an Eigenvector?,gxo1fe0,"Not really ELI5, since if you know what vectors are then that's already above ELI5 level haha Eigenvalues and eigenvectors describe the behavior of linear transformations—i.e. transformations of space that affect the space in the same way everywhere (e.g. stretch/squish space by the same amount everywhere) and also that keep the zero vector in place. (Perhaps another way of thinking about linear transformations is that they transform straight lines into straight lines, parallelograms into parallelograms, triangles into triangles, etc.) For some random linear transformation, most vectors will be transformed by a combination of rotation and stretching (so they'll be rotated by some amount and elongated/shortened by some factor). Note that the rotation amount and scaling amount is not necessarily constant for a given linear transformation—it depends on the specific vector being transformed. Interestingly enough, there are often some vectors that the transformation will transform only by scaling, with no rotation at all; these are the eigenvectors of the transformation. For each eigenvector, the amount by which the transformation will stretch/shrink the eigenvector is called the eigenvalue of that eigenvector. For instance, if I take the transformation of the plane that ""flattens"" all vectors onto the x-axis (the orthogonal projection onto the x-axis), then the eigenvectors of this transformation are (1,0) and (0,1). (1,0) lies along the x-axis, so it isn't changed at all, so its eigenvalue is 1. (0,1) lies along the y-axis, so it gets collapsed down into the zero vector, so its associated eigenvalue is 0. (If you're paying very close attention, you might notice that (2,0) and (0,2) are also eigenvectors, as are (3,0) and (0,3), etc. In fact, any multiple of an eigenvector is also an eigenvector. So when we list out the eigenvectors of a transformation, we usually just list out one eigenvector from each ""family"" of eigenvectors, with the understanding that any multiple of the given eigenvectors will also be an eigenvector.) Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are useful because it's really simple to describe what the transformation does to them—it just scales them by some factor! So if we apply the transformation many times to an eigenvector, it'll just get scaled by the same amount over and over again. In contrast, it can be difficult to predict what applying a transformation to an arbitrary vector many times will do to that vector. Moreover, if a transformation happens to have enough eigenvectors, then we can actually completely characterize the transformation by taking note of how it transforms all of its eigenvectors—i.e. by noting all of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This can make repeatedly applying the transformation very easy, since we can just reduce a more complicated transformation into simple scaling of certain vectors. (This is the principle of diagonalization.)",2920

t3_na0qwv,ELI5: How does 3D printing work?,gxquqwl,"There are several different 3D printing technologies, and they all work a little different. That said, the most common one in consumer grade printers is fused deposition modeling (or FDM). In this particular technology a plastic ""wire"", called filament, is fed through a nozzle just barely hot enough to melt it, which causes it to stick to the surface under the nozzle. The nozzle is moved via computer generated commands in a pattern that builds up the 3D shape one layer at a time. The second most common is stereolithography (SLA). In this technology the printing medium is a UV reactive liquid (called resin) which hardens when exposed to light. A screen at the bottom of the printer lights up the resin at the correct points to harden it as the build plate slowly pulls it out of the tank. This technology is capable of MUCH higher detail than FDM printing, but the resin is messy and toxic, requiring the use of rubber gloves and significant post processing to make the prints safe to handle. I believe the resin is also expensive compared to FDM filament, but I can't say for certain on that because I don't have a resin printer (my house is not well ventilated and my cats are stupid enough to try to drink the resin).",1227

t3_nad32z,ELI5: Why does driving at high (interstate) speeds and hitting standing water (deep enough to splash) cause you to feel a push perpendicular to your car's movement?,gxsz5f8,"Hoo boy. That is a simple question with a very complex answer. To understand why you need to understand torque and angular momentum in spinning bodies. So the basics you need to know is we measure the force of something spinning by its angular momentum. This force is a tangent to the circle or a straight line only intersecting the spin at one point. You can visualize this by spinning something on the end of a string then letting it go. That object on a string will fly off in one direction. That direction is the direction of the force being applied at that moment. Which indicates to you the direction of it's angular momentum. Now we go to torque. To make something spin it needs to be fixed to a singular point. There must be an axis which it spins around and resists that straight line force we call angular momentum. Otherwise the spin would just turn to linear force. As we know from physics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. So as the axis pulls against the object, so to must the object pull against the axis. That pull on the axis is what we call a torque. The direction of that torque force is defined with a right hand rule. If you point your right hand and curl your fingers in the direction of the spin and stick your thumb out, the direction of your thumb is the direction of the torque force. Notice your thumb is now pointing perpendicular to the spin. (A YouTube video to explain it in depth https://youtu.be/mRZGdvJQnPU) Now we tie that back into your car. So all 4 wheels on your car are spinning. As we just established that means they have angular momentum and torque. Fortunately for you the torque is normally not enough to overcome the friction between your tires and the road. So you never feel that torque. However, when you hit a deep enough puddle, all that friction is removed and the perpendicular torque force of your car easily can pull you sideways.",1902

t3_nahjdx,ELI5: Apparently time goes by faster where there’s less gravity (further from earths surface) and I’m wondering how that works?,gxtozkm,"Time dilation is a real thing but this is a misunderstanding of how it works. Don't worry though, it's hard to wrap your head around. Time dilation is the perceived difference in elapsed time from the perspective of different observers. Time dilation can be caused by gravity (different observers at different distances from a gravity source) or by velocity (different observers where there is a difference in relative velocity). The key thing is that you always experience time normally. You either see the other observer experiencing more or less time than you. This is a natural consequence of the fact that the speed of light is the same for all observers in all reference frames. I think this is best illustrated visually, and if you watch the train animation in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AInCqm5nCzw&amp;t=193s), you'll see how it works. That video explains time dilation due to velocity but the principle applies to gravity as well because gravity is the warping of spacetime by mass.",1010

Note, unless you're in school you don't need to do actual cursive, but some people find it faster to join different letters together. But as long as it's legible and easy to draw you can develop your own style. Once you're comfortable running letters together, now practice for speed. To do this just write a lot by hand. Concentrate on keeping the letter forms consistent, whilst also reducing the time needed to make a word.

There's a separate chemical reaction happening at the positive electrode, where incoming electrons recombine with ions taken out of the electrolyte, so completing the circuit.",818
t3_nb7qx5,ELI5: why do we say “uhm” when we’re thinking? I’m multilingual and it seems to apply to most languages. What makes it so “universal”?,gxxvisb,"Uhm and similar sounds are [filler words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_\(linguistics\)). Their main purpose is to signal that the speaker isn't done speaking. Often times we need a half second to think of what we want to say next. If we let that moment fill with silence, others may take that as a sign we are done talking and then start with their own thread. Filler words serve the purpose of signifying we have more to say. This is a universal problem. It is not surprising other languages have come up with their own filler words. Eliminating filler words from important speeches has the benefit of making the speaker sound more worth listening to. Someone who is used to being worth listening to wouldn't be worried about others interrupting their speech with their own. So we naturally give more weight to those who don't use filler words. In day to day conversations between friends though, filler words serve an important function.",947

Just go up and ask them to spot you or something, use a reason like that for the interaction, then introduce yourself. Over several trips to the gym, seeing them again and again, make small talk. Don't hold them into long conversations. People are at the gym to lift or work out, not to socialize. But over time, bits here and there, you can become friendly. Maybe after a while you are on a friendly basis with them, you greet every time you see each other, you talk shit, etc. At that point, invite them out with your friends to a party or bar or something. Hang out with them outside the gym, build an actual friendship up. If you mean to a lady? Like you are trying to hit on a girl at the gym. Fuck off. Seriously, fuck off. DON'T DO IT. Women go to the gym to work out, not to be hit on by random creeps. If you do this, you are being a creep. Not only that, but also you are going to fuck up that chick's situation. I've talked to multiple lady friends of mine that have had to quit a gym membership and find a new one because of a creepy guy. Don't be that guy. Meet girls in the normal venues.

t3_nbv986,ELI5: How does pitch relate to tuning in music?,gy1ld13,"Pitch is determined by the frequency of the sound waves so higher frequencies = higher pitches. Amplitude is defined by the size of the wave so bigger waves generally = louder sound (there are some tweaks to this like perceived volume based on human physiology, but for ELI5 bigger waves are louder). When you are asking about tuning, the 440 is a reference pitch by which everybody tunes. The instruments tuning will probably have different amplitudes (loudness) but they will all be referencing the same pitch (440 Hz). The progression of the reference pitch upwards from 440 to make it brighter in practical terms means they are just all agreeing to a different reference pitch. F#, A, Eb and other identifiers like that are notes that represent pitches since it's easier for people to say give me an A than it is to say make your instrument give me 440 Hz. By the way, the relationship of pitch to amplitude is that humans perceive some pitches as louder than others even though they might all be at the same sound pressure level. Check out information on Fletcher Munson curves or equal loudness contour for additional information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour",1189

Jesus has been depicted as the son or avatar too Yahweh, Adam was a member of the Fallen Stars created by the Creator (another possible Yahweh) and merged with the Nexus of All Realities and is the ancestor of Man-Thing. An evil aspect of him also tried to destroy mankind and fought Ghost Rider. Moses was human but worked miracles threw Yahweh, such as when his staff turned to a snake in his confrontation with Pharaoh's sorcerer, who became the immortal Sphinx. His staff was later used by Solomon Kane. King Solomon was a human Sorcerer Supreme. His legendary Brass Frogs of time travel were in his tomb in Wakanda.

t3_nd2j76,"What did de Saussure mean when he said, ""In a language there are only differences, without positive terms?"" And what did Christopher Ricks mean when he answered (paraphrased), you can't just have difference, you have to have difference *between* things?",gyaz62h,"As for de Saussure: in language, first off, there is no essential and necessary correspondence between any given signified and any given signifier. Nothing about the word “cat” forces us to use it to refer to the thing that we use it to refer to. Hence, different languages have different words: Katze, neko etc. If there were a positive term of some kind, it would necessarily lead to a word being the same in all languages, as there would be something essential about that word, which makes it refer to this or that thing. This is, very obviously, not the case. Therefore, de Saussure argues that any word derives its meaning from what it is not, or rather from how it is places or used (and how it differs from other words) within a given language system. Your example here is not optimal, a better one would be something like this (I think this is the example that he uses himself in the course on general linguistics): what are the differences between a house, a hut, an abode and so on. These words take on their respective meanings through the fine differences between them but these differences only crystalize once you have multiple different words. I’m not sure what exactly you meant when you said that you felt de Saussure’s understanding to be very incomplete, but I hope this helps in some way.

I really like this one place that was 12 EUR/night and it's an apartment near Patisia, so if you're with friends you can really have it cheap, when you share expenses. And the food in Greece is not that expensive as well, especially if you skip only eating at restaurants and buy stuff from Lidl or other supermarkets. When I go there, I usually book places that are a bit outside the historic centre, because prices are not too high there and Athens has a very efficient night bus network. And for the food, we just eat out only for dinner. For breakfast we usually went to Lidl and buy some fruits or some baked stuff, for lunch - Goodie's and for dinner, some nice restaurant near Monastiraki.

This is used forecast weather, which is notoriously inaccurate; in order to create an exact model of realistic weather, you would probably need something orders of magnitude more powerful. Now, let's talk animals. The Oracle says that all of the animals we see are programs running on the mainframe, which means processing power s dedicated to all of them. A computer that can accurately model a mouse brain has [one million cores](https://www.fanaticalfuturist.com/2018/11/this-million-core-neuromorphic-computer-simulates-a-whole-mouse-brain/), and performs [200 quadrillion calculations per second](https://www.fanaticalfuturist.com/2018/06/ibm-summit-supercomputer-worlds-fastest-ornl/). That's for *one* mouse brain. This estimate suggests there are about [2 million rats](https://rattrapinc.com/new-york-city-rat-facts/) in New York City. Rats aren't mice, but they're probably close enough, so the machines will need 2,000,000,000,000 processing cores, performing 2 * 10^21 calculations per second, *just to model the rats in New York City*.

It’s subconscious mind is still tied to the mortal/living world where it just “knew” that going through the floor was an “impossibility”, so, in the back of its brain, as long as that thought lingers, the subconscious is keeping it above ground. I would imagine going through walls is, at least to an extent, a *conscious* thought anyways, something the ghost has to think about and *willingly* do. As the ghost loses its perception of reality, or, loses its “grip” on the mortal coil, it’s get easier to do things like go through floors/walls/etc. And eventually… probably why ghosts fade away to nothingness, when they’ve completely lost all grips and connection to the mortal plain, there’s nothing left to hold them here, so they dissipate to nothingness.

And in a way they will be right: both characters are super warriors, brooding and have plot armour (to various degrees). Yet other people (myself included) will say that they are some of the greatest characters in fantasy. Because they are interesting and have memorable personalities and quirks.

I'm not necessarily scared of a bigger guy trying to pick a fight with me (which has never happened because I get along with almost everyone), but I'm intimidated in the sense that often times they're a lot more sexually appealing to girls. I grew up in a family where height was extremely favored (I'm asian), and both my siblings grew up to be tall despite our parents being both on the short side. I was always expected to grow so much more with my father saying things like ""in just a few more years, you'll be so tall and big!"" Which never happened. It just worsens when almost every single one of my exes had a thing for tall guys. Like if we/they saw someone really tall, it'd just sorta be blurted out y'know? One of my exes even went as far as to tell me (after our breakup) about how they just dreamed of dating a tall man. So it's not like a ""I'm scared of tall guys"" thing for me.

They forge a wholesome (for the Joker's standards) father-son relationship and the clown begins training the monkey to become his new partner in crime.

Like, everyone knows that a teen taking a customer service job is doing it for the spending money. Just noting that you want to try and learn from what is likely your first experience in the workforce will probably be the best thing you can do to signal ""I'm not going to waste your time or be lazy/a drain on the business"" which is all they really care about.

Even if you put a lot of quirky personality traits into a character, they'll still come off as dull if who they are doesn't do anything to the story. With regards to personality traits, one common thing I see that tends to make characters more boring is over-balancing: sometimes you can just see that the writer's acting like character design is an RPG with point buy, where every strength has to be paid for in a flaw: and, more often than not, they use the same set of pairs. Kind but naïve, bookish but miserable at socializing, etc. In general, with personality quirks and traits, I'd say to focus on ones that affect how the character interacts with the plot: if all of your character's traits are tangential to it, those'll come off as boring because, well, those traits don't matter much.

There's a bunch of things going on here, but a propeller is significantly more efficient than other ways of creating thrust. That's why wind turbines look like giant propellers. A turbine does not create thrust (""wind force"" in your question). But definition, a turbine takes energy \*out\* of a moving fluid. Things that make thrust are putting energy \*in\* to the fluid. We call those propellers or fans; there's no rigorous definition difference, although in aviation ""propeller"" means ""thing without a shroud"" and ""fan"" means ""thing with a shroud."" \*If\* you don't have a speed constraint, a propeller is the most efficient way to add energy to a fluid. That's why small aircraft, commercial turboprops, and boats all use propellers. They don't go fast enough to run into the speed problem. Commercial &amp; military jets, however, go so fast that the efficiency of propellers drops way off because they start getting near supersonic speeds. That's why they use fans instead. You have to be going a couple of hundred miles an hour, at least, before this becomes an issue. Since that ""never"" happens with wind turbines, they also don't have to deal with the speed issue and they use a design that looks a lot like propeller.

I believe it largely has to do with reading being a lot more complex than we take it for. A whole lot goes into even reading this sentence. You have to recognize the letters, decode what sounds go into each syllable, then figure out the word. Once you have the word in mind, you have to pick out its particular meaning. You then string together all the words in that sentence to try and see if the meanings you picked out for each word make sense together. Punctuation factors its way in as well at this step. Now you summarize that sentence into a thought, and each of the other sentences found in a paragraph. You take those thought and you should be trying to summarize them into what that paragraph is trying to tell you. Now you've understood the smallest amount of what's on a page. Just now you did that complex set of multi-step operations several times. It takes A LOT of brain power, but most of the time it's pretty subconscious. But if at any step there is a snare, for example not knowing a word, or not having a grasp of the concept a sentence is trying to convey, your brain has to spend more power trying to pull meaning out of the jumble. That's usually what causes the issue your describing. Your brain is trying to spend brainpower on something but you don't have the OOMPH to spare. You could be distracted, tired, emotionally drained, or a combination there of. And if the brain power isn't there for say, giving meaning to the sentence, all you did was look at and recite words. At that point it wouldn't matter if they were English, Chinese, French, or a Cypher like rot13, they were meaningless to you and you can't synthesize, that is to say learn, something from nothing.",1926

t3_nhae8y,ELI5: How does a turbocharger work in a car?,gyv6lep,"Both turbocharger and supercharger are trying to compress air to fit more in the cylinders so you can spray more gas in and get more power out of the same volume of engine. Supercharges are fed by a belt on the engine so they work at full capacity even at idle. Turbochargers are fed by the exhaust so they hurt a bit at idle and only really help at high RPMs A standard [turbocharger](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Turbocharger.jpg/2560px-Turbocharger.jpg) is two axial flow turbines bolted together. For the hot side on the left, the hot exhaust is forced in around the edge of the fan which forces the fan to spin and the gas escapes through the middle on the axis(axial fan afterall) that the fan is spinning around. This fan is on the same shaft as one on the air intake that works the exact opposite by taking in air in the center and flinging it out to the sides. Now when the piston opens the intake valve the air rushes in because its at pressure instead of being pulled in by the piston alone. Superchargers come in a lot more varieties. Screw superchargers are basically two intertwined screws with a tiny gap between them. The threads on the screws grab the air and force it down between them into a higher pressure area. Superchargers are nice in that they give you boost at low revs which is good for performance, but also eat up a good chunk of horsepower which hurts fuel economy. Turbochargers extract wasted energy from the exhaust and use that instead of useful energy the pistons extracted so they can be used to improve the fuel economy of engines and let you use a much smaller engine for the same power/torque (see Ford EcoBoosts). Their main downside is not working across the power band but that has been resolved with a lot of modern designs that can move parts on the fly to change the turbo between a low resistance mode for efficient cruising and a high boost mode for high boost when needed",1948

t3_nhajw2,Why do some companies have 2 12 hour shifts instead of 3 8 hour shifts a day?,gyv8063,Shift changes are not free. Depending on the type of work you may need some time to prepare for each shift and then clean up afterwards. Even getting to and from the work station might take some time. You might need the workers on each shift to brief each other during a shift change. This means that shifts might be longer then the 12 or 8 hours intended for the shift or you might need to shut down production during the shift change. Even if the company manages to get away without any direct costs of the shift change employees might still not be happy with the frequent long commutes involved. With 3 8 hour shifts some of your workers will not be home until night and some of your workers will have to get to work early in the morning. And this can make workers disgruntled and they will be tired while working.,817

However, I realized as I was halfway down the driveway that I had left the CD in the house. I was thinking of it enough to hum the melody, but not enough to pick it up as I went out the door.",449
t3_nhau1c,ELI5: What is a SPAC (Special Purpose acquisition Company)??,gyvbvyz,"You can divide companies into publicly traded and privately traded companies. Publicly traded companies are the ones that are listed on a stock exchange so anyone can buy individual stock as a commodity. And although this does allow small time investors to easily invest in the company there is a lot of requirements for reporting and publishing information. So companies do not like to do this due to the overhead it creates and the difficulties keeping some corporate secrets. So being a private company is often preferred. These companies are not listed on a stock exchange so if you want to invest in the company you need to go talk to an existing investor and ask them to sell some of their shares to you. This usually means that only larger investors are willing to invest in the company as they are the only ones with the time and resources to do their due diligence and ask the sellers for lots of internal paperwork and interview the employees and such to predict exactly how much the company will make in the future. Going through such a process can of course be stressful but it is better to do it once in a while rather then all the time. And the people doing the due diligence signs an agreement not to disclose any of the information to the public. A Special Purpose Acquisition Company is a company that is intending to circumvent some of the process associated with offering a company share to the public. They sell shares in the SPAC, which is an empty shell company and therefore have very little to report to the public. After getting enough small investors on the public stock market they will go ahead and buy a private company thereby making them public. This might not sound like that bad of an idea opening up more investment opportunities for small investors. That is until you realize that the part of the process they are circumventing is the part that is intended to protect small investors from investing in fraudulent companies without any real value. Even worse most of these do not even say what company they are looking at buying and at what price. This things that needs to be determined in the due diligence process which you as a small investor have very little control over. These companies are often compared to blank checks. Investing in a SPAC is like filling out a check and not filling out the recipient but just specifying that you want shares for it and then handing it to a random stranger on Wall Street. Most of the time you end up losing money.",2492

That you can manipulate experience and feeling through physical manipulation isn't anything new. The point is to find an explanation. (2) It doesn't disprove any opponents of physicalism. Dualists have often maintained psycho-physical connections or laws (or may be sometimes, epiphenomenalism). Panpsychists too doesn't have to say anything different here. Idealists (depending on the variant) don't even believe in non-mental physical stuff in the first place; they will just say you are modulating some conscious experience through the ""image of physical"" acting as an interface, but still being within the mind nonetheless. It doesn't even threaten ancient pre-scientific non-materialist positions, to be honest. (3) I am not saying this cannot act as an evidence for physicalism in some sense, but those who find physicalism problematic would still find it problematic; this doesn't bring anything new to the table.",960

t3_nihp6j,"eli5 that If most foods raise insulin levels, how does a ketogenic diet work?",gz1vx9j,"It’s not the same as calorie restriction. Insulin is released by the pancreas and while there is a sugar sensor there to release it, there are also various other mechanisms that influence the release of insulin. Some of these include signals that your stomach and intestines send to the pancreas. This explains why we know that orally ingested glucose will cause a greater spike in insulin than IV injected glucose. Your body normally uses carbs as it’s fuel source, they’re readily available and quick and easy to use. Extra are stored by the liver and extra extra carbs can be chemically modified to be stored as fat. By not eating carbs and relying on fats and proteins, you deplete your body’s carb reserves within a couple of days. This then reverses that fat storage process and will convert the stored fat to energy and occasionally back into glucose. There is a lot of nasty biochemistry underneath this explanation, but that is the gist of what is going on.",966

t3_nioh5v,"Fucking magnets, How do they work?",gz3kbzm,"Magnets are made of metals that contain many electrons. Each electron has a negatively charged magnetic field that surrounds it, and the field has a direction, perpendicular to the direction the electron is spinning. (See right hand rule). An electron is like the Earth. It, too, has a north and south pole, defined by its magnetic field. In non-metallic metals, the fields of the electrons point in opposite directions for each atom, causing the fields to cancel out and creating a net magnetic field of zero. However, in a magnetized metal, the magnetic fields point in the same direction, creating a net non-zero magnetic field. The magnetic field of a magnet, because it is formed by magnetic fields of the electrons, also have a north and south pole, which is why most magnets also contain two poles. Two similar poles repel each other while opposite poles attract. When a magnet nears a non-magnetized metal, its magnetic field causes the electrons in the non-magnetized metal to align and face their opposite poles towards the magnet, causing a magnetic attraction, which is the force you feel when you hold a magnet next to another metal.

The 2 girl’s mom’s were FURIOUS but decided to let all 3 of them sleepover. My friend, the birthday girl, was extremely sad because her friends couldn’t stay, and that made her mom upset because she felt like her party was ruined.

As I began to really like F1 I started spending more and more of my free time with it. (Less whatever and more F1.) I found that there are many ways of learning to play properly. You need to know how real F1 rules are to get the most out of them, you need to learn how the fucking game works because sometimes it can be a mystery. Beyond literal learning there is physical practice when you learn tracks and the car. And there is racing experience like with strategies. So a lot of stuf to worry about but what kept me hooked for so long is how you always feel like improving even after hundreds of hours.

t3_njm8qe,How do you write something that is inspired by another show/book but not make it very similar?,gz8yyqg,"If there is something you like about a show and want to be inspired without being a rip-off, you have to identify not only what you like it about it, but also why and how it works so well. Too many people copies something they like without grasping why it worked so well in that specific context, and so their copy feels flat and contrived - because it is. You have to find a way to deconstruct and identify the essence of the show that you like, condensing it into a simple format, so you can conceptualize what makes the show great. By detaches what makes the show so great from the show itself, you can apply the concept without referring back to the show it came from. That way you can make something that draws inspiration from a show, without it ultimately hinging on that show. You can't just copy a scene from a show and expect the impact to be the same, but if you deconstruct and identify what makes that scene so good and apply those principles to your own thing, then you can recapture the essence of what made that scene so good in a way that complements your own story. Of course, you could always just identify what makes the show great and try to be inspired to make something wholly unique based only on those themes, and develop your own ideas from there.",1273

t3_nju89e,"ELI5: what is the difference between oil-based, water-based and graphite lubricants in how they function?",gz9l4l7,"Water does NOT make a good lubricant. About the only thing I can find that uses water based lubricants is sexual lubricants. The lubrication is not provided by the water itself but by creating gel that works similar to grease but in a much thicker layer. Oil is your standard lubricant and works in different ways depending on the specific application varying from where it's only filling the microscopic layers on a metal's surface to providing a full boundary layer such that the two metal surfaces don't meet at all and thus no welding or wear occurs between the microscopic peaks on the surfaces. Without lubrication two metal surfaces will weld to one another under heat and pressure. Oil circulates in a system where as grease (oil + thickener) stays put. Dry lubrication (like molybdenum disulfide or graphite) functions like a grease where it stays put but it has hundreds or thousand of sacrificial layers. So each time the surfaces met a layer of the dry lubricant is taken off instead of wear occurring to the metal surfaces. It's more expensive than purely oil based greases but can be applied on a much thinner surface, used with much higher temperatures and potentially lasts longer depending on the application.",1226

So I don't want to say what is normal for ADHD, just speak from my experience. &gt; there is definitely a risk of being exploited when I'm only being paid for 30 hours of work The way I have always treated this in my jobs is, they are paying me for 30 hours of output, not 30 hours of being on the clock. When I have a week where I spend a lot of time goofing off when I'm supposed to be working and therefore end up spending 60 hours at the computer instead of 30, I don't consider that exploitation. Obviously everyone has off-weeks, but this happens very regularly for me and it is an idiosyncracy of my brain, and I don't think that my employer should pay for that. Maybe this is wrong, but that's how I see it. &gt; my boss said that I ought to be able to crank out something like 15 pages a day Whether that's a reasonable expectation or not is a different question, and I appreciate that it's a difficult one to answer when you're also living with being easily distracted. It may be that your boss's expectation is not reasonable *and* you're not producing enough by some objective standard. And it's hard to solve both issues at once. It does sound like the situation is becoming hostile though, so from a completely different perspective- I'd start looking for a new placement. &gt; how much distraction time is normal for a healthy person to be included in their work hours When I was researching this, a number I found frequently was 45 minutes on/15 minutes off if you're not hourly.

The physical is used as a representation of the moral and thus the wicked is as misshapen as the righteous is fair (as shown by the double meaning of the word). I often end up on the wrong side of this, but I must admit: I don't care much. &amp;#x200B; Of course we are writing in our own time and in our own globalised culture, but we should maybe not take too literally what is meant to be symbolic. If you are going to write a somewhat realistic story, of course it doesn't make sense for your characters' flaws to show in their appearance, but one might argue that a fairy tale wouldn't have to follow the same rules. Then again, maybe in your story, fair hair is a sign of duplicity (I don't even mean in a complex, fantasy-like imaginary culture, but as simply as Roald Dahl wrote that witches have square toes and wear pointed shoes.

Honestly, the only people whos opinions should matter are those closest to you and whoever is paying you money/giving you grades. Think of it this way: In schools and jobs, when its over, youll never see any of these people again unless you want to, so it doesnt really matter much what they think. Thats just a fact. Ive been to two colleges, in the second one I realized its kinda pointless giving so much mindshare to worrying if these guys like me or not, we'll all be out of here before we know it.

t3_nl0hl8,"ELI5: How do ""flash loans"" in blockchains with smart contract support work?",gzfyz90,"&gt; This concept just doesn't pass the sniff test.. That's cryptocurrency for you. &gt; This seems like it allows one to attempt to profit without any downside. My understanding is that the borrower has to pay a fee no matter what happens. This is all generally used for arbitrage, i.e. exploiting price discrepancies between equivalent assets or between different markets. People do that with normal finance too, e.g. they'll buy a commodity on one market and simultaneously sell the same thing on another market for a higher price, or they'll buy and sell some combination of financial derivatives that effectively ""cancel out"" and leave them with a profit no matter what happens. This does sound too good to be true, but in practice it can take a lot of work to find and exploit arbitrage opportunities, and there is always *some* risk, e.g. a market might suddenly crash in the brief period of time between executing the transactions, or you might run into a legal problem that renders one of the derivatives void. With a ""flash loan"", the loan, the arbitrage transactions and the repayment are all rolled up into one transaction. And similarly with standard arbitrage, there are possible downsides - apparently people have found ways to exploit loopholes in the system and cheat the other party out of money. By the way, a very common assumption made in economic models is that arbitrage literally never happens, which tells you a lot about how much trust you should place in economists' pronouncements about the economy. &gt; What about the third party in this case? If someone takes out a flash loan and buys crypto from me, then the crypto goes down in price (meaning that they can't make a profit), how is the transaction rolled back? I sold them crypto and now that sale is undone? Since everything happens in a single transaction, for the third parties I don't think it would be any different than if the transaction had failed to go through for some other reason.",1976

t3_nl8lhw,What is time (in the Kantian sense)?,gzjl1hh,"If you understand that time is a pure intuition and so on, I'm not sure I understand your question. Are you wondering what time is in itself, independently of its being a pure intuition? Because Kant denies that it's anything other than this. If you're wondering what in particular is distinctive of time as the particular kind of pure intuition it is, then the relevant passages in Kant will be *Critique of Pure Reason* A30/B46 - A36/B53. Kant claims 1) that time is an *a priori* subjective condition on our being able to represent things as simultaneous or in an order of succession, the formal structure of which ordering is given in arithmetic; and 2) that time is immediately the form of inner sense (that is, of the sensible appearance of the soul), rather than of outer objects as such, since time does not itself make possible the representation of shape, but that time is also mediately the form of all sensibility whatsoever, since whatever we represent to ourselves sensibly occurs as an inner representation in the mind, and as such is mediated by the form of inner sense. Here are some particular passages you might find helpful: &gt; Time is not an empirical concept that has been derived from any experience. For neither coexistence nor succession would ever come within our perception, if the representation of time were not presupposed as underlying them *a priori*. Only on the presupposition of time can we represent to ourselves a number of things as existing at one and the same time (simultaneously) or at different times (successively). (A30/B46) -- &gt; Time is nothing but the form of inner sense, that is, of the intuition of ourselves and of our inner state. It cannot be a determination of outer appearances; it has to do neither with shape nor position, but with the relation of representations in our inner state. (A33/B49) -- &gt; Time is the formal *a priori* condition of all appearances whatsoever. [...S]ince all representations, whether they have for their objects outer things or not, belong, in themselves, as determinations of the mind, to our inner state; and since this inner state stands under the formal condition of inner intuition, and so belongs to time, time is an *a priori* condition of all appearances whatsoever. It is the immediate condition of inner appearances (of our souls), and thereby the mediate condition of outer appearances. (A34/B50)",2398

That's on the extreme side of things, but of course platonic contact between members of the opposite sex is completley possible. This question really gets at one of the emotional problems that arises becuase of how maleness/masculinity is treated by our culture. For (heterosexual) men, physical contact is basically violent or sexual. That's why one of the only ways that men have physical contact with male friends is roughhousing. That's why when a female friend initiates or engages in platonic physical contact with them, they have a tendency to assume it's an indication of sexual interest. It's pretty miserable, tbh. I don't know what it will take to normalize platonic physical affection for men, bit it kind've needs to happen.

She drove a Thunderbird. This was 1958-59. She invited several of us to lunch at her home one weekend. It was beautiful. She had a porcelain figure of a dog on a chair that I was staring at. Without saying one word, she wrapped it up and gave it to me for my birthday. As an adult, I invited her to dinner with four other students from our class. We had all managed to sidestep the inner city pitfalls. We all thanked her for changing our lives and the lives of so many others in our class. She was 80 and still vibrant, funny, and beautiful.

If monotheism is true, then there is only one god -- in the strict sense that there's only *possibly* one god -- so there's no worry (literally no *possibility*) that you could have proved the existence of a god but not the right one or the real one. &gt; The Pascal's wager fails if we allow the existence of multiple gods/religion... But if monotheism is true, then other religions aren't talking about different gods -- since it's not possible for there to be such things -- though they might be saying things about God that you disagree with. &gt; ...then there will be a big probability that the rituals you are doing following YHWH may not please Vishnu for instance who is actually the supreme god, so you will be condemned to the eternal cycle of rebirth. You've suddenly switched gears here from the question of the existence of God to the question of what rituals we should or shouldn't do, when these are plainly very different questions. (Though perhaps this confusion is an artifact of your failing to grasp the consequences of monotheism, per the previous two points.)

Being harmless out of fear is not a virtue. I imagine it is hard to find balance between cordiality and being unfiltered if you have the habit of being too nice, so here is a simple formula: try to phrase the truth in a respectful way (not harmless, someone will inevitably be upset). If you’re saying something for the sheer purpose of pleasing someone, don’t say it. If you’re not stating your own opinion completely honestly then either say nothing at all or be authentic. Yes, do care for others but also for yourself. Respect yourself by standing up for your values. I know it can be tough, I personally am naturally avoidant of confrontation.

Sometimes, the motivation is obvious from the beginning. Sometimes it seems obvious, but then the actual motivation is revealed midway through, or even at the end. And of course sometimes it is a complete mystery until the middle or end. What I often find with this one though, is that if the motivation is not at all clear by that point, it’s often because we (the audience) don’t know who the villain is yet, or the villain is more of a shadowy character about whom very little is known. Once the villain is found, their motivation usually becomes known soon afterwards, or in the case of mysteries, we start to learn about the motivation first, then connect that to a suspect to get a full picture. Certainly, having the villain’s motivation gradually revealed over time works too, but it’s not the only good approach. It’s really up to you :)",957

About a year after highschool I was a cart pusher at walmart. A coworker and I goofed off alot because we finished our work fast and had downtime so wed use it to just joje and talk. One day we found a cart full of fruit and on the fruit there was a sticker price tag. I took one of the stickers and put it on my shirt joking about my worth to Walmart. At lunch one day I decided to try the sub shop down the road and inside there was a small line. The last couple in line, to my surprise was a highschool bully I had and his gf. This guy would make fun of people because of their looks, weight, activities, he got laid alot presumably, cursed at teachers, kicked out of class, laughed at you in gym class with his friends, good looking....you get the picture. We stood there awkwardly, the restaurant was relatively small so we were pretty close to eachother. He turns and sees me. He recognizes me and acknowledges me. ""What's up man"" he says with a smile ""how are you?"" Being polite and knowing this guy is a good reason for my social awkwardness and fear of being judged in public, I say ""Hey _____, im doin alright how are you?"" He keeps smiling and now his gf is looking at me smiling. I knew her aswell, though not very familiar with her, I say hi. ""Awww cmon man, you're worth more than that"", he reaches forward and pulls the fruit sticker off my shirt. I remember the whole restaurant went silent. I remember everything in slow motion, the smell of bread and pizza in this little restaurant became very pungent and I could feel the hot pavement from the parking lot still hot on my shoes. ""Haha yeah it's just a joke at work, I forgot about it."" He then explains his day and where he is working. The whole time he is talking, the line gets shorter and he gets his pickup order and leaves. I felt my face getting fuzzy and I felt like I was losing my skin. The moment was so awkward and uncomfortable and even had a touch of being pleasant. It was my first and so far only time a former bully was nice to me after hs. Not sure if he was just nice because his gf was there (not that he cared in hs, same girl) or what his deal was. But all in all, a weird experience. Saw him at an Arbys a few months later. He smiled and waved at me. I think he got his ass kicked one day or found god. Moral of the story, my diet was awful. TL;DR at the top.",2414

t3_nmhxis,How can we have moral knowledge if moral non-naturalism is true and the physical is causally closed?,gzopbia,"Are you not rather begging the question when you assume that moral truths are a posteriori? a priori a posteriori man himself Kant thought there were a priori moral truths. &gt;For Kant, there is a close connection between the nature of moral truths—in particular, their prescriptive content (i.e., what they direct one to do), as well as their necessity and universality—and the way in which we discover those truths, namely, a priori. In his view, one can discover a maximally general, fundamental moral principle. This is a principle that he calls “the categorical imperative”. Kant holds it can be known through reason alone, specifically, via a transcendental argument (see entries on Kant’s moral philosophy and transcendental arguments). He held that we could then deduce more specific, but still general moral truths from this fundamental principle. Kant provides various formulations of the categorical imperative, the first being that one ought to act only in accordance with a maxim[3] that one can at the same time will to become a universal law—roughly, an act ought to be done by someone only if the person could will, without contradiction, that everyone act as he or she is acting. Examples of more specific principles he deduces from the categorical imperative are that one ought not make lying promises or commit suicide. Kant’s discussion of lying promises nicely illustrates how the categorical imperative works: A person in some difficulty is considering making a promise he knows he cannot keep to escape the difficulty. To apply the categorical imperative, the person must consider what would happen if everyone in some difficulty made a lying promise to escape. If so many lying promises were made, no one would believe a person who promised to do something, so under these conditions one could not escape a difficulty by making a promise. Hence, the person could not consistently will that his maxim be a universal law, since making it a universal law would frustrate his aim in making the lying promise. Therefore, one ought not escape a difficulty by making a lying promise. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-epistemology-a-priori/",2165

I was in 2nd period English, dreading the upcoming math test, when the entire school building just shook. Most of us thought it was an earthquake, which is uber rare on Manhattan island. The bell signaled the end of the period and I was heading to my next class when I saw a bunch of kids running up to the 5th floor. When I reached to the spot where everyone was, the North Tower was on fire and we saw the plane hit the second tower. The worst thing is that you saw like flakes coming off the building which later on, you realize those were people jumping or falling out of the building. School security came and brought us all to the school Auditorium. There was a huge line for the public phone as kids tried to call their parents. The school locked up their doors after NYPD came in to ensure no one comes in and out. I try to contact my parents but they didn’t picked up (my mom by the time, was walking home from Long Island City and my dad got sent home from Midtown. We were desperate for information and all we had was the radio station but they knew as much as we did. Then, all the sudden, outside our school windows, people started panic running up 6th Ave when a giant cloud of grey smoke just overtook them. When the cloud was gone, it looked like a Baron landscape. We were all stocked there to about 5:30p when the A, C, and E trains started running again. I got home to find my parents and sister safe. We were off from school for a week, returning back next Monday. Many kids didn’t came back since they had family members working in WTC. We started doing the Pledge of allegiance in class again (first time since elementary school). A lot of kids had a panic attack when Flight AA 587 went down in Queens a few months later, but it was just as bad as many kids in my school are Dominican and lost someone in that crash too. My neighborhood, Washington Heights, was devastated because of that flight as it has legendary status.",2022

t3_nnow3d,"Thinking about meeting people, what would you prefer: organizing events/gatherings, joining other events/gatherings or staying at home?",gzvxgxy,"As a fellow introvert, I say all three options work really well, but this is how I would approach each option: A - mostly works with friends who have a common bond (school, work, interest, etc). Trying to get a random group together may or may not work if there’s nothing that they have in common. B - this works well if you can keep your expectations of meeting people low. Instead of focusing on trying to build a core group right away, focus on one small task for socializing throughout the night like: talking to one person you’ve been meaning to talk to, ask for contact info for one person to keep things going, or join a smaller group (like 2-4 people) for conversation. C - nowadays it’s pretty hard to develop a bond with someone purely out of circumstance. If you’re able to start small talk with someone out of nowhere this could work, but since people nowadays tend to keep to themselves when going out (and also with the pandemic enforcing social distancing and mask mandates in businesses) it’s almost impossible for others to want to make small talk to you. In regards to doing things alone: you can always try to ask existing friends/acquaintances if they’d be interested in joining you for doing certain things. You gain companionship if they join and if they don’t you still get to do what you were planning to do anyways. Best of luck OP!",1357

It is nuclear fusion. “In nuclear fusion, the nuclei of atoms are fused together to make new, bigger nuclei. Since the nucleus of an atom determines what the atom is and how it behaves, a change to the nucleus causes the atom to become a new element. For instance, two hydrogen atoms fuse together to make one helium atom. Nuclear fusion does not require oxygen. In fact, you don't need any other material at all. You just need enough pressure or heat to squeeze the nuclei of the atoms close enough that they overcome their electrostatic repulsion and bond into a single nucleus.” -[source](https://wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/mobile/2015/03/20/why-does-the-sun-not-run-out-of-oxygen-as-it-burns/)",721

Large mammals like elephants, rhinos and hippos were also used leading to the idea that dinosaurs would have been mostly drab, consisting of earth tones (the first three Jurassic Park movies come to mind when thinking of this). Once the link between dinosaurs and birds was established and the discovery that many dinosaurs had feathers science started looking at birds for color inspiration. Many modern depictions have wild patterns and colors similar to birds.

t3_nox0nd,ELI5: What makes mathematics factual?,h029ieq,"It depends what you mean by factual. All math is based off of things called “axioms”. These are essentially statements that you just assume are true, without any proof. The axioms used for modern math are put forth by [Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo–Fraenkel_set_theory). Generally, axioms are picked so that they make intuitive sense, like saying that if two things are made up of the same stuff, they are equal (although some axioms needed for math might be less intuitive, like the axiom that infinite sets exist). In any case, everything else in mathematics is proven by using these axioms. As a quick detour, let’s go over mathematical proving. Let’s try to show that 1 + 3 == 2 + 2. Well, first we can use some addition rules (which can be proven with set theory axioms) to make 1 + 3 into 4. Now we have 4 == 2 + 2. We can apply those rules again to turn 2 + 2 into 4 to get 4 == 4. From here, we can see that the set on the left side is made up of all the same elements as the set on the right. Using our earlier axiom, if two sets are made up of all the same elements, then they are equal. Assuming our axiom is correct, 4 == 4 is therefore a true statement, which means that 1 + 3 == 2 + 2 is also a true statement. Again, this is all assuming that we treat our axioms as true statements as well. All of modern mathematics can be proven in this manner, just using the axioms given by set theory. Of course, it usually takes much longer. A good half of a book was dedicated just to proving that 1 + 1 == 2. **Edit:** *u/komandanto_en_bovajo has pointed out that a lot of that half-book was dedicated to setting up mathematics in general, and not just proving 1 + 1 == 2, so my previous statement is misleading.* Anyway, this means that, if you agree the axioms from set theory are factual (go ahead and read through them and see if they make sense), the rest of math is also factual, since you can show that the rest of math is just a consequence of those axioms. *As a side note, nothing is forcing us to use those axioms, except that most people agree they make sense, and that they haven’t led us to any contradictions or illogical outcomes yet. We used to have different axiom sets, but those eventually led to paradoxes, sort of like the mathematical equivalent of saying “this sentence is a lie”. We refined our axioms to get rid of those contradictions, but ZF set theory could still have some that we haven’t found yet. Anyway, nothing’s keeping anyone from deciding they want to make a better math and making their own axioms, except that ZF seems to make the most sense as of now.*",2638

Like he hits it so far over the other kids, they'll be chasing it for minutes (there was always one kid who could randomly do this). So kid starts his run. He runs up to first, misses the bag, gets halfway to second before he listens to his coach, turns around, goes back, touches first. The outfielders aren't even at the half way to the ball yet. Kid takes back off for second, misses the bag. Keeps going, misses 3rd. At this point he is technically out but I will let it slide if he goes back around, and touches 2nd. He continues on home, missing home as well, just kind of standing beside it when he gets there. He is now out for a second time but I still haven't singled anything. The fielding team coach is screaming at his players to get the ball to second base (so they can touch the base since that was the first one he missed). The outfielders are just starting to get the ball back towards the infield at this point. The batter how runs up the middle of the field and stands beside 2nd (still doesn't touch it). The ball comes in, kid gets tagged and I call him out. THE COACH LOSES IT He storms out to me and just starts screaming at me. I'm 14 and this grown ass man is in my face, spit and swear words flying ""What do you mean out! He crushed it! You fking idiot! You moron! That's a homerun! Or at least the double! You stupid piece of shit"" and on and on. I'm honestly a little scared but also, fuck that guy. In ump school they actually teach you how to throw out coaches, like the hand gestures and everything. I'd never thrown anyone out and again, 14, so I try to explain ""He missed 2nd, and missed 3rd which means he was technically out. He missed home, out again. He ran up the middle of the field, out again. He stood BESIDE second and then was tagged, out again. Come on, he's out and you know that"" Yeah, not good enough for him. He launches into another rant which I honestly don't really remember. All I remember is waiting for him to take a break and then getting to throw him the fuck out (with the hand gestures and a 14 year old squeaky voice ""You're out of here""). He refused to leave, so I sat against the backstop, waited till 8:15pm, called the game due to curfew, his team auto forfeited and he was barred from coaching after reports were made.

t3_n35gr9,ELI5 Why does squinting help you see better?,gwnmeh6,"The part of our eyes that sees is actually in the back of the eyes. Think of it as pixels of a screen that the brain puts together to give a complete picture. The job of the lens in the eye is to direct light into those pixels. People with impaired eyesight usually have a lens that struggles with directing the light. As a result, each ""pixel"" recieves light from multiple directions and this gives us a blurry image. When we squint or look through a small hole we decrease the amount of light entering our eyes. By doing so we also decrease the total light getting from multiple directions at each pixel, producing a clearer, yet dimmer image.",645
t3_n35gb8,How do you quickly know if someone is stupid ?,gwnlwbj,"By the nature of the questions they ask, and the manner in which they ask them... ;) To explain this a little, a person shall ask a question to gain information that they cannot find nor determine for themselves. Why can they not do that? Much information can be gained through common sense consideration, critical thinking, and chewing over the context of the situation / matter at hand. If, after due consideration, something is still not obvious, a piece of information is missing; how then does this person seek the missing information? Do they seem to have a clue as to what is missing? Do they ask questions specifically exploring the missing piece, so that they might complete the puzzle themselves... or do they just dumbly ask for the answer to the overarching question? If a question is unlikely to be known to them or any other reasonable person in their situation, then fine, the information is genuinely beyond their grasp. But for questions that are at least partly explicable with a moment's thought, I have found this a fine predictor of not only intellect but also of academic capacity, motivation, and self-reliance. Those with intellectual curiosity tend not to ask simple / summative questions about big or complex concepts; rather, they have already been pondering the matter at hand, and are willing to ponder it further, hence asking for more detail rather than a broad--and simplified--explanation. Source: my experiences as an academic lecturing in a clinical field, and as a student of educational neuroscience developing a doctoral research question in this area.",1590

If your story involves mechanics such as time loops, I can see why you might want to have more of the structure worked out. All I'd say is, don't overplan to the point that you feel indebted to the planning work and are not prepared to strike out in a new and interesting direction as it presents itself. Also, I will sometimes alternate between the ""macro"" work of outlining and the ""micro"" work of writing pages. So, if I get stuck or feel lost in my story as I'm writing, I'll step back and take a birds' eye view of it again, maybe write a broad outline of the next five or so chapters, and then dive back in to the details.",1028

They want to say or do what they can so *they* can feel better. They don't prioritize the other party's feelings, that's just a side thought. If you've been hurt, people can pile on the emotional weight by making you babysit their emotions while also dealing with your own.

t3_n4dyug,"ELI5: what makes ankle joints withstand age-related wear and tear, comparatively speaking?",gwvnbdn,"The magic of the ankle biomechanics is more-so in the synergy it has with the foot than simply the ankle itself. The ankle-foot complex (AFC) is an extremely intricate &amp; complex structure with a high concentration of bones and muscles, connected by very supportive and flexible Connective Tissue (Tendons, ligaments, fascia). With the AFC being the first load-Bearing system of the body, we expect these Connective tissues to be far more responsive and adaptable to the stressors imposed from our body and the changing terrain. While the hips may have stronger ligaments than the ankle, the ankle has an uncanny ability to adapt to the changing environment because of the foots ability to evenly distribute the load evenly before sending the force upstream. Summing this up, the Ankles ability to alter its compliance based on the terrain it’s interacting with may cause it be more resilient to the less compliant hip joint.",928

Heat increases blood flow which promotes the ability of the body to heal. This is more useful for muscular pain such as those muscles in your pelvic area. This is more suitable for pain that is not caused by muscle tears or recent injury. Conversely, Ice slows blood flow and is best to remove inflammation and slow the process. This is why you use ice on a sprained ankle so it helps reduce swelling. Technically ice could help reduce the swelling effects but it isn’t pleasant long term!

The narrative time is (almost) equal to the narrated time, as we say in literary studies. In other words, you watch a 2-hour movie and in the movie, you see a story unfold that begins on a late afternoon and ends some time in the evening of that same day. The movie is heavily based on dialogue and interaction. When you describe the movie to people who've never heard of it, chances are high they'll dismiss it and think inside: ""ugh, sounds super boring"".

I was at a loss, how do I answer this question - especially in light of it being the first question I am being asked! I stammered for a bit, then the co-worker says with a shit-eating grin on his face, ""Don't worry, you will!"" The hiring manager then outright asks me when I could start, and oh yeah, do I have any questions. I inquired about the pay and hours and said I would be able to start immediately.

Not too big not too small. I just started noticing it more, glasses would slide down regularly. Damn. But I have learned to love my nose, my SO and I always crack jokes at our noses. He had a big nose while I have none. I know my mom means well and just wants us happy and beautiful.

She had recently had a gastric bypass surgery, and her boyfriend had previously had a vasectomy. Her periods had been irregular for years already, and when she started putting on weight she thought she was having some kind of rebound effect after losing a bunch of weight from the bypass. She figured out she was pregnant at about 7 months. Her boyfriend was (understandably) concerned because of his vasectomy, so he went and had his ejaculate tested and, oops, he had swimmers. They went ahead and got a paternity test once the kiddo was born and it was definitely his. It was a roller-coaster of a few months, I'll tell you what.",675
t3_n6zjli,"If your obese and have kids, what are the chances that the kids will turn out obese as well?",gx9ywod,"Pretty good. Even if (like in most cases) it’s not genetics, your kids will mimic you and your behavior, including your eating and exercise habits. My dad has been roughly 200 pounds for over 40 years, since he was 13. It’s changed from fat to pure muscle and everywhere in between, but I’ve taken after him. Just without the muscle part. When he was younger and did sheet metal and roofing 10-12 hours a day 6 days a week he was shredded. When he was in middle school, he was obese. He would fatten up during school season and over the summer he’d gain more muscle as he worked every day. But his eating habits never really changed, he’s addicted to Mountain Dew and has always weighed about 200 pounds. He’s passed that on to me and my brother. But we don’t do nearly as much manual labor (thanks to him working his balls off for 30+ years to get into a position where we own a successful business) so we just stay... in shape (round is some sort of shape, right?) Long story short you need to start teaching your kids healthy habits as early as possible, and because they learn from your behavior, the best way to teach them is to do it yourself.",1149

Demonstratives, for example (e.g., *this* and *that*) allow us to refer to things even without names for them. But virtually every academic discipline encounters phenomena that isn't yet named and then generates names for them. For instance, there was a time when we didn't have a name for complex or transfinite numbers. Then we realized what these kinds of numbers can do, and so we developed names for them. You see something similar with moral and ethical issues. Prior to the middle ages, people really didn't have the concept of a person having a right to something. That changed with the enlightenment. Prior to the '70s, we didn't have a name for sexual harassment. Then Camitta Wood coined the term to name the experience that she suffered at her job. Etc.",865

t3_n7kybx,"ELI5: What does it mean to ""own the float"" in regard to stocks?",gxdda9o,"Some wrinkle brained ape will explain this better, but I’ll give it a shot. When they own the float, they are talking about the shares that investors like you or me can buy. This is nothing exciting until you add in the naughty things the hedge funds have been doing. Very simply put, hedge funds have been selling shares that they don’t own. So many in fact that if they were ever ‘forced’ to give these real shares the the people that bought them, they would have to buy 1.7 times or more of the total float (depending on how naughty they have been selling fake shares). So imaging you have 10 bananas, and the hedge funds (HF) only have 3, but own someone else 15 bananas. They will give their 3 away, pay you basically whatever you decide to sell your 10 bananas at, plus they have to rebuy 7 more bananas from the person they owed 20 bananas to, and give them back. And that’s if you even want to sell them. You might like the stock (company), and bot want to sell. Now it’s all much more complicated then that, as the hedge funds were actually shorting the stocks, and strong evidence they have been trading off market to manipulate the prices of the stock.

Another good one is to ask... “Can you briefly tell me about three people whose careers have been positively impacted by you?” If your answers are how they made their boss look good by some heroic deed or accomplishment, or how they singlehandedly saved a deal or the company and made the CEO or owner more successful... you are dealing with a self centered narcissist.

t3_n7ve69,ELI5: Why does oil not evaporate like water does?,gxf6o4e,"1. Something boiling/evaporating means its individual particles flying out of the liquid into gas phase. Different things have different boiling points - it's determined by what forces are present within that liquid. If the particles like sticking to each other, it takes higher heat to make them fly apart (aka evaporate). 2. Liquids evaporate when the temperature is above *or close to* their boiling point. Some evaporation happens *below* the boiling point because ""temperature"" is just the *average* speed of particles. Water boils at 100C, but water at 90C has quite a few individual particles moving at 100C-speed, and those are the ones that fly off and evaporate. That's the steam you see! Room temp water evaporates because even at \~20C, there are a few particles that reach 100C-speed and fly off. **TLDR**: Every liquid has an ""escape speed"" needed for particles to fly off and evaporate. The further below the boiling temp it is, the less likely its particles are to reach escape speed. The result of 1&amp;2: * Some things have lower boiling points than water, like acetone (nail polish remover, boils at 56C). They evaporate faster than water does, maybe you've experienced this? It's because acetone molecules (particles) don't like sticking together as much as water does. * Some things have higher boiling points than water. Their particles really like sticking together. Eg olive oil boils at 180C. * Net result: The oils on your face are much farther below their boiling point than water is, so they ""don't"" evaporate. (actually they do but very very slowly, everything does). Bonus: Solids are just things whose molecules like sticking together even more than liquids do. Every material has a melting point escape temp/speed too, and all the logic I said for boiling/evap above applies. **TLDR 2**: Oil doesn't evaporate for the same reason a pile of coins doesn't melt. The temp isn't hot enough to get the material in question to stick to itself less.",1975

t3_n8a5u2,Eli5 what can you do with an IP address?,gxhs1qo,"As others have said, it really depends. IP addresses identify your ISP; your ISP is likely able to map an IP address (and the time it was used) to a given customer. So law enforcement, or someone who works at your ISP, can probably determine your real-world identity from your IP address. A random person on the internet is far less likely to be able to do that; what they are likely to be able to do is identify your rough geographic area, through a variety of techniques. (The network layout of many ISPs--the IP address, but also the route to get to that IP address--often gives away some rough geographic data, at the city level; a number of services also exist that aim to do better (more accurate, finer grained) IP geolocation from other data sources.) However, again, it depends on what kind of access someone has.

Some much darker than others no doubt. The notion that the Quest might fail was in the forefront of his mind as well. Part of the theme of LotR is trusting to faith &amp; friends, that not every problem will have a distinct and exact plan to be carried out to solve it. It was enough to know they had no other option, what else was there to do than start, and keep going? Frodo reflects on this even, how is he going to destroy the Ring? He doesn't know ultimately, but it is his responsibility to try, and every step towards Mount Doom was a small victory over the darker road of fear. This was a road Saruman went down it seems, and he turned to trying to control the outcome through might, trickery and force. Gandalf rejects this road when he rejects the Ring, and many times before. And in the end it was enough, Frodo brings the Ring to Mount Doom, with much help and much effort, where his previous pity and power come back to reward him (in a way) and everyone with ultimate success.

t3_n8tspe,Why has the non-aggression principle receive so little academic attention?,gxkl5wb,"This has been asked quite a few times before, but the principal reason is that the non-aggression principle is *redundant*: 1. In order to know what counts as aggression, you need to have a theory of rights. 2. But if you already have a theory of rights, then you don't need an additional ""non-aggression principle"". With a theory of rights, you already know everything you need to know about what you may or may not do. It's actually quite telling that the NAP is mostly used in non-academic circles. Indeed, the way the NAP is wielded by non-academic libertarians reveals just how unaware non-academic libertarians can be of their own assumptions (which is to be expected among non-academic or lay audiences). Again, the NAP only has content given an underlying theory of rights. So, if someone frequently asserts the NAP, it must be because they already have a particular theory of rights in mind. However, *because* they keep focusing on the NAP, it's likely they are taking their theory of rights largely for granted. Otherwise, they'd just be discussing the rights themselves—which is precisely what academic political philosophers do!",1141

So what truly is annoying except the absence of what is socially expected? “Out of the norm,” if you will. And society is headed to complete social collapse if we continue to use the word annoying without context. Some people find nero-divergent people annoying.

Start slow, got a bunch of papers all over your desk? Turn it into a neat pile. Backpack filled with useless junk? Throw some of it out. Drawers unorganized and can't find anything you need? Go through one, fix it up, take a break for the next day. Once you've taken the time and everything looks dope, keep it up. Small things, small improvements. 4. Stop snacking throughout the day. Have a nice small healthy meal when you wake up. Something light, like fruit or a healthy bowl of cereal that isn't filled with sugars. Then keep off the sugars and unhealthy foods. If you just gotta have some snacks, more fruit or veggies. Cut out the chips, candies, etc. Now you can't never have an unhealthy snack between meals, but keep it light and don't do it every day. 5. Stay hydrated. Carry a water bottle around with you and at least take a few gulps of water every hour. Coffee and Teas are OK, but not every second of the day. Gatorade, fruit juices (welches, minute maid, etc.) are basically just uncarbonated soda, get em out of here. 6. Keep your face, body, and hair as clean as you can. Set up a skin care routine. Set up a face care routine. Set up a hair care routine. Moisturize, lotion, cut your dang nails once a week, brush your hair every day. If your overweight like I was(and I was like 300 pounds), really, really wash yourself well, I'm talking all the folds(if you don't have that issue, still, get cleaned) Don't pick at acne, stop using wash products with harmful chemicals. Use some damn deodorant and get some cologne, not something that smells too strong and godawful (I'm looking at you axe) but something light. 7. Seriously, if you don't have them, get clothes that fit. Don't wear clothing that's super baggy, don't wear clothing that's super tight. Wear some well fitted pants and shirts. I know being overweight makes people wanna cover it up, but bigger clothing just makes people look bigger. Wear stuff that fits. I promise it wont look bad. 8. Meditation is nice but it's not for everyone, especially the type where you're meditating for long periods. If you can meditate, go for it, if it's kind of hard to concentrate like that, instead try giving yourself a couple minutes every day to just sit, relax, and breath. Good breathing exercises are great for the brain and body. Even a minute of good, steady, breathing can clear up the mind. Try out the 4-4-4-4 method. Four second inhale, 4 second hold, 4 second exhale, 4 second hold. 9. Exercise. 30 minutes a day. 15 minutes if you can't do that. 10 if you can't do that. Seriously just stretching every day will help. Just do as much as you can for as long as you can, tomorrow do a bit more. You'll see improvement daily, i s2g. I can't even stress this enough though, STRETCH, STRETCH SO HARD YOU'LL not hurt yourself or anything don't push it, BUT STRETCH. Do go crazy, don't burn yourself out, but try working out as much as possible, every day. 10. Don't burn yourself out. Take it slow but put in the effort. Some days it'll be harder, but just think about how much nicer you feel, your space looks, and how you've improved. These are also just tips to start with. Don't feel like you have to get everything done all at once, that's how good habits don't become good habits. One at a time, make it easier if it's too difficult. But put in the work and stay focused on your goals.",4087
t3_n9hivj,"Restaurant employees where Kitchen Nightmares was filmed, was it really that bad?",gxpi0ha,"A bar I went to fairly often while I was in college was on a similar show. Pretty sure it was called ""Bar Rescue"". Before the show, it was fine. Nothing to write home about, but normal drinks and above average bar food. Me and some buddies went to a taping, and it was hilarious. All the normal stuff you'd expect where they stir up drama and overplay problems/upset customers. The really crazy part was the new ""menu"" introduced by the show. There were only about 3 food options and 4 ""signature cocktails"". I think everyone at our table ordered burgers, and they were unbelievably bad. The patties were basically spherical, some were raw, the buns were literally just mush with grease. Absolutely comical. The cocktails were uniformly terrible as well (also wildly overpriced). The one I remember best was a burger shot. Kinda like a bloody mary except they literally just scraped some burger bits off the griddle and tossed them into the drink. It was actually worse than it sounds. The bar kept the new menu for about one week, then went back to exactly what they had before. As far as we could tell, the owners just wanted the free renovations that came with being on the show, and decided it was worth putting up with the BS.",1231

t3_n9ipv5,How does Henri Bergson deal with the mind/body problem?,gy75y36,"Let me copy paste another of my answer Bergson deals with this problem in his great book Matter and Memory. Bergson thinks that the problem is often put in a spatial way : how an extended thing is related to a unextended thing, and in this formulation the problem is unsolvable for Bergson, he instead choose to distinguish body and mind in temporal terms, body is linked to the present and actions, the mind is linked to the past and memory. Bergson replaces a duality of substances by a duality of functions (immediate action and reflection). An animal, or an impulsive person is not free, because it reacts mechanically. The mind allows a person to distance itself from the immediate present to explore memories, in order to decide of a future action without reacting immediately. The body always selects what is useful for action (that's why we forget some memories), but human beings can try to understand their past, and to find a balance between the necessities of action, and the freedom of the mind. The mind differs from the brain, the brain is part of the body, of the present, while the mind can explore the past. Exploring the past opens a possibility of freedom, and the creation of a new future. Matter always repeat its past, human beings are able to use their past memories to create an original future.",1320

For those who don’t know RAID SHADOW LEGENDS is a free-to-play turn-based RPG that’s got like 15-million downloads over the last few months. Google Play even nominated it for an award for being one of its top RPG’s. It’s got a really cool story campaign, active PVP arenas, dungeons, 16 different factions, and hundreds and hundreds of heroes to collect and customize, and they add over a dozen new ones every single month. You can also unlock free champions, equipment, and other cool stuff just for learning how to play, which includes Arbiter (one of the best heroes in the game). As far as graphics go this game speaks for itself. It’s honestly kinda crazy how much detail these guys squeezed into a free game and for your phone, especially when you consider what used to pass for epic mobile gaming not so long ago. Anyway guys RAID SHADOW LEGENDS is constantly expanding and adding new features, so it’s really never a bad time to give it a try.

t3_naqc3g,Sleeping Beauty Problem - Is this a new approach?,gxverw5,"(Violates rule 5, but I'll answer it anyway) By ""odds"", I think you mean something like ""objective chance"". Odds of X = p(X)/\[1 - p(X)\] (where the function p(.) can refer to propensities, frequencies, credences,, a measure with no meaning, etc), but that's definitely not what you mean. Everybody agrees that the objective chance that the coin lands H is 0.5. The question is: should Beauty's credence on H (after being awakened by the experimenters but \*before\* the experiment is over) match the objective chance of H? The simplest argument for the thirder position comes from Elga's ""Self-locating beliefs and the sleeping beauty problem"", and it goes like this (my words): &gt;Let's modify the problem so that the coin is only tossed on Monday, after Beauty is awakened (which should make no difference to the solution, since the outcome of the coin only matters after Monday.). Now suppose the experimenter tells Beauty that the day is Monday. What should be her credence on H? It should be 1/2 (the experimenter can even toss the coin in front of her, why should her credence diverge from the objective chance?). But consider the propositions H1: Today is Monday and the coin lands Heads, T1: Today is Monday and the coin lands tails, and T2: Today is Tuesday and the coin lands tails. Her credence on H upon learning that the day is Monday should be P(H1|H1 or T1) = P(H1)/\[P(H1) + P(T1)\] = 1/2, so it follows that P(H1) = P(T1). Furthermore, if she was told that the coin landed tails, she should be indifferent between T1 and T2: P(T1|T1 or T2) = P(T2|T1 or T2), so it follows that P(T1) = P(T2). Therefore, P(H1) = P(T1) = P(T2). Since they have to add up to 1, P(H1) = 1/3. The two main responses to this argument are: 1. Her credence on H upon learning that the day is Monday shouldn't be 1/2. (Halfer) 2. There is something weird about conditioning on purely self-locating beliefs such as ""Today is Monday"". Beauty's credence should be 1/2 before and after learning that the day is Monday (double-halfer). How does your response differ from the two above? How would you respond to Elga's argument? &gt;Let’s say the coin is tossed, but she’s only woken up and asked when it come up H. The odds of each toss are 50% H, but her confidence when asked will be 100% H. Again, she knows the rules. If by ""odds"" you mean objective chance, you are correct. &gt;She knows every toss is 50/50 H/T, but can deduce that for every H she is asked about, there is a T she isn’t. All flips were 50/50 H/T before they were tossed, but if she knows the frequency of those flips she is not asked about (because the flipper is using their advantage of knowing the outcome before asking her and can thereby distort her certainty level however they like), she can use the inverse to determine the odds of what she is asked about. The odds of those H flips are offset by the T flips she can assume happened. She doesn't need any complex argument to know that the ""odds"" (objective chance) of H is 0.5. It's always 0.5, it never changes, it's something we assume for the sake of argument. Similarly, her credence on H is 1 in this case because P(H|The experimenters woke me up &amp; the experimenters only wake me up if the coin lands heads) = 1. &gt;Back to the original problem. For the flipper, when the first T comes up, there’s no difference between: &gt; &gt;\* Flipping that T on Sunday and asking her twice (Monday and Tuesday), and &gt; &gt;\* Flipping that T on Sunday, asking her on Monday, and then flipping the coin Monday night as many times necessary (ignoring any H) until another T comes up, and then asking her on Tuesday using the new T. Those intermediate H flips are independent and irrelevant. &gt; &gt;In Case 2, it’s similar to the original 100% H situation earlier. Here, she’s just not being shown those intermediate H! You are right that if the coin lands tails, it makes no difference if the experimenters choose one of these two options. &gt;So that means for every first T, the flipper would be toss on average one H before the second T. But the flipper doesn’t ask her about those, just like the T flips in my first 100% H scenario. Correct. &gt;In fact, in my first example, the flipper could have just tossed an H and left it there, and then woke her up each Monday and asked about the same H every time. There’s no difference in the odds or anyone’s outcome. When you add the intermediate flips, none of the events wind up being dependent on each other (unlike having each T actually cause both T1 and T2), but it doesn’t change anything. Asking twice about each T just skips the unnecessary step of tossing the one expected H before the second T and then asking about that one. If I understood this right, that's also correct, although it's a bit confusing. &gt;Imagine if the flipper did also ask her whenever an intermediate H occurred. It would then be 50/50 H/T from all perspectives. That's the crucial step. You propose a modification of the problem to argue that i) the solution is clearly 1/2 in the modified problem, and ii) it should therefore be also 1/2 in the original problem. But i) and ii) are not obvious at all. Why should her credence on H in the \*first coin\* be 1/2 if the experimenters toss a second independent coin many times, no matter what? Also, why should this be relevant to the original problem? I'm also not sure what your conclusion even is.",5403

Whether they turn immediately after ending the pedestrian signal or some time after is also a decision based on road width and traffic flow.

Don’t ask me why, just do it. Sip frequently. 3) if you find yourself in a terrible rut of unproductivity (i’m talking about weeks and weeks of minimal input), get a haircut. Straight up. 4) be aware of how you talk to yourself. 5) give nofap/nosurf an attempt and see whether they suit you. 6) if you ever feel unproductive in the morning, make a plan to order pizza or tacos or whatever it is that you like in the evening. This definitely gives you something to look forward to. for obvious reasons, practice this moderately 7) when bored and sulky, just reminisce on your good times or think forward to whatever plans you have with your friends. look forward. gives you a kick of enthusiasm. look man, some of these may sound stupid, but that’s the point. these are really just random things that have helped me get through unproductive ruts. i hope you get it all figured out man. remember to give it time. oh and btw, you’re 20 you have a shit ton of time to do better and heaps of opportunities coming your way.

It hasn't been observed because the circumstances are extreme, like requiring infinitely long, infinitely massive cylinders. Here you have Interstellar, Predestination, and the first Terminator. 3. **Multiple timelines**.

That's price gouging. Any other changes in price, in any situation that isn't a crisis, or in any good that's not strictly critical, is not price gouging. It's other changes in price resulting from other changes in supply and demand. That's not to say that rising prices are never a problem, as long as they aren't price gouging. They could very well be a problem! They could be a result of rampant inflation like in the 1970s, or of a financial bubble like real estate in 2008, or of a company attaining monopoly power in its industry.

t3_nd95tv,ELI5: Why do modern windmills have only 3 blades?,gy9h02r,What do you define as efficiency? If efficiency is the percentage of available energy that you can get from the moving air then more but and thinner blades are more efficient. Aerodynamic efficiency increases with number of blades but with diminishing return. 1-&gt;2 blades is 6% more efficient 2-3 blades is a additional 3%. The move from 3-&gt;4 will add less. There are [one bladed wind turbines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine_design#/media/File:Mod-0_Wind_turbine.jpg) So you need to build more blades so increase cost. You also need to decrease the width of the blades so all blades will cost more for the same strength. The result is if efficiency is the power of the wind turbine vs the cost of the wind turbine the 2-3 blade is optimal because the cost of more blades increase more then the extra power you get out. So build adding more wind turbines for the same cost is more efficent. So for normal wind power parks more blades are not better.

It has to be done at the appropriate distance so the the light have time to blink, gates closing etc. A device that detect trans is called a [Track\_circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_circuit) The simple way is to have have isolated gaps in the rails so not electricity can pass along the rails.You then have a electrical circuit that with a connection to each rail and when the steel wheels of the train roll onto the track they create a short and you have a electrical current between the track. Now you have a signal that tells a train is on the track and you can activate the crossing So you use the two rails and the train wheels as a large eclectically switch. There is more advanced circuits that you use if it is a electrical train and the rails is used and one connector or if the system should handle trains with large speed difference so there is not unnecessary long blocking of the lines for slow trains.",1029

t3_nddwa7,"ELI5: most of the screens we look at are 2D, what makes our brain perceive it as 3D or normal images?",gya3ith,"There's a bunch of things that your brain/visual system use to try to determine the position of things you look at in 3D space, and artists can use a number of those factors to make 2D images read as if they have depth. One of them is scale. Our brains are constantly comparing the size of objects that we're looking at with the size that we know those objects to typically be. A person that takes up a lot of our visual area is likely rather close, while a tiny person is likely far away. Another is perspective. The way we see things, parallel lines tend to converge as they move further away. So drawings can be made that mimic these types of perspective. A third trick is that things that are a good distance away tend to look hazy due to all the extra atmosphere the light is traveling through before getting to our eyes. So sometimes artists can add in some haze to make objects look distant. There are more tricks than this, but hopefully that gives you some idea.",971

So if you stand inside of a huge inflated basketball, you will feel no gravity from ut. The proof is calculus, but you can also imagine it as a version of two inverse-squares equalling each other, which is how Newton proved it. Now, if you imagine the earth as a bunch of concentric shells (like a jaw breaker with different flavors), it is clear that gravity goes down as you tunnel through the center of the earth/shells.

t3_nejwgv,So what exactly IS Yggdrasil?,gyjrqds,"So Yggdrasil is the name for the pathways that connect the nine realms that is easily traversable using the Bifrost, and navigable using the old Dark Magics. My speculation is that the branches of Yggdrasil were either artificially created, or somehow strengthened, by Odin when conquering what is now the nine realms. Either using the Space Stone or the Dark Magics. Odin stopped his conquests after the first Convergence event because he realised that his creation/strengthening of Yggdrasil to the nine realms meant that as they moved through space the branches of Yggdrasil moved with them and, once in a while, aligned to create the convergence event. He realised that he'd already connected too many realms to Yggdrasil and if he connected any more Convergence events would happen more often - and with greater intensity. That's why Odin stopped at Nine Realms. His sudden pacifism was borne not out of a sudden change of heart, but the realisation that his bloodthirst could give their enemies a chance to destroy Asgard. He didn't tell Hela this (or maybe he did and she just wouldn't reveal it to Thor/Loki) because he knew her bloodthirst would drive her conquer more regardless (""Just one more realm"", ""if they try to use the convergence to invade we'll bathe in their blood"" etc)",1291

t3_neqyy7,How can i write contradictory characters?,gyhymvv,"My thought is that you have a very good understanding the subtleties of characterization. What you are saying is absolutely perfect. People shift from hour to hour sometimes. The main heart of the novel (a well-written one) is how a person grapples with conflicts or emotions, of understanding, and of viewpoints of reality. The obstacle is overcome because of choices, often hard choices, so it must be a hard obstacle. -- Write what you want to write and don't listen to those other voices trying to control your writing because they are not doing it-- you are. Also-- characters who are totally consistent all the time are called wooden or shallow. Stories that have only wooden characters are called melodramas. They are puppet shows, not awesome writing. I don't think you should change a thing. Move on with the understanding you have now. Hopefully you are keeping up with good writing. Don't read cartoony things, read complicated character-driven novels. This is also a warning to not show your writing to other people too soon. They will try to dictate how you should write it.

t3_nf4tj4,ELI5: Can you travel to a particular coordinate in space?,gyjovp1,"Theoretically, sure, but it's not quite the same. The surface of the Earth is 2-dimensional, but space is 3 dimensional, so you have to specify 3 coordinates, not just 2. On Earth, we use east/west and north/south, and that gives you a fixed location. In space, we project an imaginary sphere around the earth and use coordinates called declination which tells us the angle above or below the equator, and right ascension, which tells us the the angular distance measured eastward from the equator at the vernal equinox. Those 2 things only give you a direction, but space is 3 dimensional, so you need a 3rd coordinate as well: distance. If you give a right ascention, declination, and distance, you can give ""directions"" to any celestial object. It's also important to remember that everything in space is moving, and coordinates are only meaningful from a fixed point of reference, so depending on where you are and where you're going, you may need to choose different reference points. Also, space travel doesn't really work like that so it's not useful for that purpose. It's more more locating and tracking celestial objects, not as a means of navigation.

The capacity to measure time is among the most important of human achievements and the issue of when time was 'created' by humankind is critical in understanding how society has developed. Until now the first formal calendars appear to have been created in Mesopotamia c, 5000 years ago. In 45 B.C., Julius Caesar ordered a calendar consisting of twelve months based on a solar year. This calendar employed a cycle of three years of 365 days, followed by a year of 366 days (leap year).

t3_nfu4r5,"ELI5 : Are ""more GB old graphic cards"" better than ""less GB new graphic cards"" ?",gynjj6b,"Very broadly the amount of VRAM - the GB - a card has will limit the maximum resolution of the textures in the game. This usually goes up with the resolution of your output. So if you have a 4K screen, those GB become more important. If you have a 1080p (or lower) screen, it's less useful. Of course, higher resolution textures and output resolution don't come for free, so it's possible you might find a game that's sufficiently demanding that whilst you have loads of GB of VRAM, the card isn't powerful enough to actually run it at a high frame rate at high resolution. Conversely you might find another game where the primary demand is the VRAM, which acts as a ceiling before your graphics card processor is even breaking a sweat. So the answer isn't clear cut. However generally speaking - and this really is general - each generational jump (ie 1070 -&gt; 2070 -&gt; 3070) will see the last two digits deliver roughly similar performance to the model above it previously. So 1080 = 2070 = 3060 and so on. But this is very much just a rule of thumb, there are plenty of exceptions and certain bottlenecks (like VRAM) will make the actual performance vary from game to game. The short answer, though, is that the 3060 will be better than the 1070. You may notice the loss of 2GB if you're doing something with very high resolutions, but a 1070 is going to struggle to provide you with decent frame rates at high resolutions on a modern game anyway, so it's not really worth worrying about.",1495

It doesn't mean he's going to be standing over your shoulder helping you study. He might suggest getting extra help from your school/teacher/tutor. It might mean the two of you can sit down together and evaluate your study habits, find where there may be a problem that can, when it's addressed, be solved. The key here is help. You're not asking him to do it for you, so this means that you'll have to give it your all to see things through. It also means checking in honestly and saying whether that is helping or if you're having problems still that may need further tweaking. But my advice before you approach him is to take a beat and try to figure out where you went off track. Can you uncover the reasons you wound up getting a poor grade? Were you not studying? Not understanding? Did you ask for help then? Are you staying healthy and balanced? Getting enough sleep, exercise, eating ""brain food""?

It is by far the biggest, most complicated, ugly, down-right dangerous language you can use. But it does run fast. It takes at least twice as long to program in C++ as any other major language (except C). The men who program in C++ are Real Men. The women who program in C++ are Real Men too.

t3_nhbezd,ELI5: How can spellcheck possibly work as well as it does?,gyvjy0l,"It's all clever organization and a little bit of math. There's two things here: spellcheck and when things ""suggest"" words to you. Both are interesting, but you asked about spellcheck. ""Algorithm"" is a word we use for certain kinds of computer programs. There is one algorithm that tells us something interesting. Given two words like ""basketball"" and ""basekball"", it tells us the ""distance"" between them. That ""distance"" is how many letters we'd have to add, remove, or change to turn one string into the other. So if two words have a really short ""distance"" by this algorithm's reckoning, they're close. To make spellcheck really fast, a fancy data structure is used. One person mentioned a binary tree. This would be like putting the shortest ""M"" word on a pillar with two doors going left or right. If your word (""baskeball"") is ""less than"" that ""M"" word, you go left. That presents you with a ""G"" word, you go left again, and eventually you're looking at ""B"" words. Each time you make a choice, you cut out half the possible words. That's still pretty slow if we have the 170k or so commonly-used English words. We can do better. Now imagine you see 26 doors: one for each letter of the alphabet. Our word starts with ""B"" so we go in that door. In theory, we just cut 170k words down to 1/26 of that in one go, that's way better than half! Next we go in ""a"" because the word starts with ""ba"". By the time we walk through ""b-a-s-k-e"", we find out there isn't a door that has ""B"" on it. That means there are no words in the dictionary that start with ""baskeb"", and we only had to make 5 comparisons to try it. So the computer takes a step back and looks at all the words that start with ""b-a-s-k-e"", assuming that the 'b' is probably the typo. There are probably only maybe 20-30 words total that start with ""b-a-s-k-e"", so the computer calculates the ""distance"" between all of them and ""basekball"". Two candidates will have a very low distance: ""basketball"" and ""baseball"". So the spell checker is *pretty sure* one of those two is what you meant. And instead of having to check 170k words, it only performed about 40 total comparisons and maybe spent 1,000 operations on the distance calculations. 1,040 things is much faster than 170,000 things. Sometimes a lot of words have a low score. In that case it usually just guesses. Sometimes the dictionary data has extra data with each word that's a kind of ""popularity score"". There could be some really obscure word that nobody ever uses like ""basekebab"" that's really close to your word as well, but if it has a very bad popularity score the spell checker might ignore it unless it's the ONLY option. How does that popularity score get calculated? It's sort of magic, but also pretty obvious. The people who write the spell checker get a bunch of digital books and run them through a program that counts each time a word is used. The more often a word is used, the more popular it must be! Obviously this gets really influenced by what books are chosen, so different algorithms can make different suggestions. In fact, that's mostly how auto-suggest works too. That data structure with the ""doors"" is used to find the ""close"" words to what you typed, then popularity data is used to guess which of the closest words are the most frequently used. A big difference is those tend to ""learn"" popularity. If you select a word, the ""popularity score"" changes to make it more popular. That way, if you use a lot of words that aren't common, eventually your computer learns to suggest those. Some of these algorithms are very smart and look at the whole sentence, so they learn ""this word usually comes after that word"". But the way words and numbers are stored to handle that is MUCH more complicated.",3749

Why do they just disappear instead of floating up to the top once they’re already formed??",gyyu8mq,"Heat *is* motion. Those little bubbles are spots where the water is so hot, and moving so fast, that it actually pushes away the water around it and becomes a little bubble of steam. The steam is water molecules zipping around bumping into the liquid water hard enough to keep it away. It's actually lifting all of the water in the pot directly above it! As you point out, steam is lighter than water so this bubble does start to float. As it does, it moves out of the super-hot bottom layer of water that's right against the heating element. As soon as the water around the bubble gets a little colder, it can't sustain itself. The steam bumps into the cold water and loses energy. As it slows down, the water above presses in. The whole thing collapses! Basically because the bottom of the water is the hottest, it gets to the boiling point first. Steam bubbles can only just survive there during this phase of heating. Stirring the water as it heats up will make these bubbles take longer to appear, but once they do they'll be able to rise through to the top much faster. This is because all of the water will be heating more evenly.",1137

If data is not being sent in parallel, shouldn't you only need one pin each for send and receive, one for ground, and maybe a fourth for clock?",gywkgg6,"I can't speak to HDMI, but PCIe I know. The simple answer is the analog of water passing in a pipe. Just as the water in a pipe goes 1 part of water (cross-section area) in series at a time if you watched closely. The simple difference of x16 vs. x1 is that you have a pipe with 16x the diameter vs. ""1x"" or ""normal"" diameter. Similar to how a fire hydrant is a very wide pipe, but a bathroom sink is a narrow pipe. Pipes allow water to flow in a straight line, with varying widths. Why is this useful? Some PCIe uses are for graphics cards that need that x16 diameter pipe to display your mind-blowing videos. Some use cases are just a slow wifi adapter that can use x2 or x4 because the pipe requirements don't need as much ""water"" or ""information"" all at once. Getting deeper, PCIe was invented for flexible use cases that were unforeseen at creation. They allowed a way for future uses to continue with the same interface for ease of computer design re-use (i.e. processor design re-use). Yes, it is a ""serial interface"" - but it's actually complex and using all those pins in parallel too. It's actually a configurable set of ""serial interfaces"" in ""parallel configuration"". If you need to know the details of a serial interface, it simply means that the data contains the clock embedded in the data signal itself. There is a ""PCIe Clock"" signal, but that isn't for data collection, just coordination at the low-level and proper reference alignment to ensure the 2x processors that are talking to each other know what is going on. The details are scary, so just reply if you must know.

The General Projective Transformation (GPT) is used to handle these coordinates. If you ""draw"" a line between any two points at infinity, they define the line at infinity, which goes through all the points at infinity. BTW, (3,5,0) refers to the single point at infinity in both ""directions."" Using an appropriate GPT, you can transform the point at infinity to become local, but another point, previously local, becomes inaccessible, i.e., at infinity. Because of the convenience of using HCC via the GPT, this has taken over computer graphics internally. I learned this at MIT in 1960 when our math was mostly done by hand.

t3_ni1aki,Do I have the right motivations for graduate school/ Am I pathetic?,gyzgrnw,"This seems less like a youthful goal and more like a serious neurosis. In first order because this whole grad school project seems entirely hypothetical - you can apply, but as a person with a 10 year old degree, bad grades and no research experience, the amount of time and money it would take you to get in makes me think that you haven't really considered this seriously, because if you had, you'd immediately discard this option. I mean, if it means that much to you, throw caution to the wind and start over I guess - but when you're at the level of self-loathing you seem to be at, it's highly likely that achieving the goal isn't actually going to fix the self-loathing, because it's self-perpetuating at this point. Like, a late twenties person asking the internet if they're pathetic is a bit alarming from a how big is the hole inside perspective. If I were you, and I had the kind of money you'd need to invest in grad school prep, I'd take it and invest it in a good therapist.",989

If you didn't want to spend that, you could pay the slightly cheaper tram down to the exit and pay 5 dollars for the toilet. That path just went to the exit. To get back to the park, you had to ride a stupidly long and very expensive train that went all the way around the park and dropped you at the entrance.

I talking half of your yearly paycheck. What would happen if they decided to not pay you back at all? You would go on but at a drastic different lifestyle considering you have lost a lot of income. Eventually you will make enough to recover but what if you lost your job in the mean time? Or got in a bad accident? The rest of your bills would start piling up and you might not be able to pay your bills and have to cancel your debt with bankruptcy..... See how that snowballed?

In this sense, the answer is pretty simple. Though, of course, doing it will require a lot of work. &gt; are the characteristics we ascribe to each movement actually ideas that were in the minds of people in that time, or have we just back-projected things onto them? Ideas about these things in popular media (or in remarks in scholarship that isn't on this topic but included as ""popular wisdom"" or whatever) tend to just reimagine this period in a way that pleases whatever ideological point someone wants to make.

When I get an idea, I write the title, a few notes and go about my day. When I sit down to write, I actually have a topic I want to write about. As for improving your writing, the best way to do this is keep writing. Once you have enough material, you will definitely see areas where you need to improve and you can focus on them. One more thing that is especially specific to blogging: **writing every day does not mean posting every day.** Write every single day and decide how often you want to post/publish. I started posting/publishing once a week. Once you're in the habit of writing every day and posting/publishing every week, you'll be ahead on content.

t3_njg89d,"Did Democritus and/or Leucpipus respond to Zeno's paradoxes of/arguments against motion? And if so, how?",gz7vuht,"I searched the book *The Atomists: Leucippus and Democritus* for mentions of Zeno and didn't find anything about responses to his paradoxes of notion, although the book mentions on p. 164 that there was an atomist argument against the infinite divisibility of matter which was similar to the [argument from complete divisibility](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradox-zeno/#ArgComDiv) which was said by Simplicius to originate with Zeno. But the book also argues on p. 165 that there was a conceptual difference between the argument attributed to Zeno and the atomists' argument: &gt;There is, however, a crucial difference between Zeno's focus of interest and that of the atomists. Zeno is trying to show that every magnitude must be infinitely large; his argument is that every magnitude is divisible into lesser magnitudes ad infinitum, and that an infinite number of magnitudes of finite size sums to an infinite magnitude. This argument is concerned purely with theoretical division. Physical division ad infinitum of every extended thing is not possible in practice, and even if it could be demon- strated that below a certain threshold physical division is theoretically, and not merely practically, impossible, the argument would not be weakened in the slightest. The atomists, on the other hand, are concerned to show that things cannot be physically divided ad infinitum. That emerges clearly from their question 'What will be left when the division has been carried through?' If this question is asked about mathematical division it is only too easily answered; suppose that the infinite mathematical division of an extension has been completed, what will be left will be exactly what was there at the start, viz. the original extension. But if we think instead of physical separation, the force of the dilemma is clear. Imagine the original extension to have been separated into infinitely many subparts; then we are left either with an array of extended things, each requiring further subdivision, or with a set of unextended things. According to https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atomism-ancient/ there were some ancients who proposed the idea of ""time atoms"", i.e. the idea that change proceeded in discrete increments and was not infinitely divisible. It's possible this idea was partly meant as a response to Zeno's paradoxes of motion which assume the infinite divisibility of time, but the idea is not attributed to Leucippus or Democritus, the article in [this section](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atomism-ancient/#PlatPlat) that Plato may have believed in time atoms: &gt;It has been suggested that Plato accepted time atoms, i.e., indivisible minima in time, but this is controversial. A report by Aristotle suggests that the belief of Plato’s student Xenocrates in the existence of indivisible lines was also shared by Plato; other testimony suggests that points are really what Plato refers to as indivisible. And in [this section](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atomism-ancient/#DiodCron) it says: &gt;For those who posit indivisibles as a way to escape paradoxes about infinite divisibility, parallel arguments might equally well have been applied to the problem of completing tasks in an infinitely divisible time. Sextus Empiricus reports that the Aristotelian Strato of Lampsacus (d. 268/70 BCE) argued for time atoms, although this is contradicted by other sources. Sorabji 1983 suggests that Strato merely countenanced the possibility that time could be discrete while space and motion are continuous, without endorsing this position.",3582

Of course, the ""Do not Disturb"" sign was up, so we didn't say anything. Again the knock came, and we looked at each other like WTF. Then the door began to open - by passing privacy locks - so they were clearly using the management override on the lock. The door got 1/4 of the way open and I said, ""Hey, WTF are you doing?"" The door slammed, and I opened it in time to see the person round the corner of the end hallway. I ran after them, but being mostly naked I didn't pursue them too far - also what was I gonna do if I caught them? I was just hoping to get a description I guess. I suppose they were coming in to rob us, but didn't expect we would be in the room.

Otfried PreuBler's books - I loved Krabat I read Scandinavian children's lit authors like Lindgren, Lagerloef, and Jannsen in German - the translations are top-notch.

t3_nl0xnx,Why do mythological gods hide from humans in the modern era?,gzfzth6,"Percy Jackson and the Kane Chronicles both seem to make it clear that they don't need direct worship (even though half-bloods apparently provide it anyway), but their existences are sustained by the concepts they embody. They don't need to appear to big crowds because the impact they had on society is still felt; we still build statues and monuments according to the Greek ideal. And if Western civilization were to fully collapse, Olympus and the gods would cease to exist. Pan ceased to exist because of environmental devastation, and other deities who simply become irrelevant in modern times have faded as well. On the flip side, monsters thrive on chaos and destruction and will exist as long as those things plague society. In other works you get the indication that they have to redefine themselves because they've been out-competed by Christianity.",858

t3_nla6sx,"[Star wars] When Han Solo said go to hell, what belief system was he referring to?",gzhj8u3,"just a slight correction: ""The Force"" in and of itself is not an afterlife. However, the Netherworld of the Force IS an afterlife where everyone's soul ascends to after their deaths (not just Jedi or 'good people') . A section of this Netherworld is called Chaos... and in Corelian mythology is actually termed ""Hell"". It is not unlike our hell, as it is the area of the Netherworld of The Force where the souls of the evil reside... Sith Lords, evil apprentices, and really just about most other evil beings as well. The terms Chaos, Hell, and even (I think) ""The Void"" are used to depict or describe the same dark pit of space of The Netherworld of The Force. So, to answer your question directly, it would be Corelian mythology. Although it's the same basic premise among all those who believe, despite the actual term being used.",833

When he first walked into the kitchen, I instantly knew who he was (from his acting work). Waiting tables in a high-end place can make solid money, with the benefit of being able to largely work your own schedule. I'm not saying this is what everyone does, but this guy has a fairly long and distinguished career of middle-tier acting work and low-level writing/directing work. I could never really put my finger on it, to be honest ... His resume would suggest he didn't need to wait tables, but he did!",749
t3_nldisg,[Dc comics]How does Superman’s ability to fly work?,gzie0ae,"According to Ben Tippett's ""A Unified Theory of Superman's Powers"", all his abilities come down to one thing, an ability to alter his inertia and the inertia of things he touches. From the section on flight: &gt;According to our conjecture,fight could be achieved if Superman were to lower by His own mass, and increase the mass of the air with which He is in contact. Flight could then be achieved and sustained by pushing the ambient ""heavy"" air about him. This mechanism, however, does not confine him to Earth's atmosphere; since even outer space is not a perfect vacuum. It's nonzero density should provide enough dust and gas for Him to accelerate by pushing Himself off of it (in addition,He might be accelerate by selectively radiating high intensity photons). &gt;Our conjecture does not only suggest a mechanism for His fight, but it also clarifes some issues concerning how He has been observed interacting with objects, in fight. &gt;Imagine the familiar scenario where a heavy stewardess falls from an airplane, and then Kal El intercepts and catches her, mid fight. This Scene is illustrated in figure 2. If Superman obeyed the laws of physics we would expect that, once Superman caught the stewardess, their collective trajectory would suffer as a result of her monstrous initial momentum. Additionally we would generally expect her to be crushed under the large acceleration, and torn in to pieces by the considerable impulse. &gt;However, from experience, Kal El rarely dips after catching someone midair. This seems only possible if, somehow, Superman were able to reduce the momentum of the caught person. Furthermore, the caught person reports feeling much pressure or acceleration from Superman's arms. If the stewardess' moment of inertia were dramatically reduced prior to the impact of Kal El's arm, her body would suffer less from the impulse, as it would be lightly felt. https://qwantz.com/fanart/superman.pdf",1936

t3_nldylb,eli5 why is burning calories such a slow process compared to accumulating them?,gzi3r61,"&gt; why is burning calories such a slow process compared to accumulating them? You are thinking about this the wrong way. Your body is a very efficient machine that burns just as many calories as it needs. This is a fairly consistent amount of calories that you can estimate by [using a calculator](https://tdeecalculator.net/), and you can then confirm by weighing your food and weighing yourself for a couple of weeks. The rate that your body burns calories can be increased slightly by your activity level, but there are limits to how much you can increase it. So if you eat only as many calories as your body needs, burning them is not a slower process than accumulating them - it is the exact same speed. If you eat fewer calories than your body needs, burning them is a faster process than accumulating them and you lose weight. If you view food as nothing more than fuel for your body that takes time, money, and effort to consume, the question then becomes why do people expend more resources than necessary to consume calories they don’t need and their bodies can’t burn?",1081

I would be like 'Augh I hate this teacher he never listens and he sucks at his job and he targets me... Yes he does target specifically me...' and I would bring up examples. I also try to tell jokes while talking and make smart points and observations and sometimes use fancy words and end up explaining my other self what they mean.

t3_nld66e,ELI5: Why does missing someone hurt in the body?,gzi17hd,"Emotion and physical pain are very, very closely linked. When you feel physical pain, your brain receives information from a pain receptor and immediately cross-references it with other senses, your immediate memories of what you were just doing, your long-term memories of similar situations and sensations, *and your emotions* before it decides whether or not what you are feeling is pain. Emotional pain has a similar process. Your brain processes it in exactly the same way, using the same pathways. It will cross-reference all the input it can, including your physical sensations, memories, thoughts, and feelings, before deciding if you are in pain or not. And then your brain sends out a pain signal. Because emotional pain does not come from a physical pain receptor, your brain chooses a body part that hurts on behalf of your emotions. The usual contenders are heart, gut, or head. These are important, generalised areas that can hurt when something Is Wrong. So basically it’s your brain letting your *body* feel pain as a way of processing your *emotions*.",1068

Always give yourself plenty of space, that goes for driving behind somebody, stopping behind somebody at lights/signs and maneuvering. The more space you have the easier it is to see what's going on and you give yourself that little bit of extra time if you need it. Look well ahead when you're driving and try to think ahead, if you're looking well ahead and you see a sign warning you about a side road, that could mean that there have been lots of accidents because a car has been waiting to turn and somebody went into the back of them. You could also seek out further professional instruction (in the UK we have PassPlus and Advanced Driver which are not mandatory but I found them very helpful). One of my friends paid her instructor to sit in with her in her own car when she started driving even though she had already passed her test.

t3_nn9rja,"ELI5: How is HTTPS any more secure than HTTP, if literally anyone can implement it?",gzuicly,"All that a TLS certificate is, is a signed witness statement by some group (an ""authority"") that says, ""This guy is who he says he is, I checked. Signed, XYZ Authority"". You only get certificates if you can somehow prove to one of these authorities that you are who you say you are, and that you own the web domain that you say you do. Convince them of this, and they'll sign you a certificate. Practically all consumer computers come pre-installed with a list of groups that the computer will trust right out of the box. If your computer goes to a website and that website provides a certificate signed by someone on that list, your computer will trust it. If you click on the padlock in the address bar, that will show you the website's certificate. If you inspect the certificate, you might see a ""Verified By"" section--that's the authority that issued the website its certificate, and presumably, it will be one your computer is trained to trust. Thus, the point of a certificate isn't specifically how hard or easy they are to get. It's all about *who* you get certificates *from*. I could easily run some software and generate you some perfectly secure certificates, just as good as any other certificate out there. But it won't be worth anything because that certificate will be signed by me, some random nobody that isn't on anyone's trust lists. You could even have your server create and sign its own certificate (a so-called ""self-signed"" certificate) if you want to, but again, no one would trust it. If you want a certificate that you can just throw out onto the Internet and have almost everyone trust it right away, you're going to need to get a certificate from one of the big boys. You can find this list on your PC and edit the list to add or subtract whatever authorities you want. Some private networks like ones you might find in offices or school campuses often do this when they launch internal websites. They'll create their own certificate authority, then instruct all the computers on the network to add the network's new authority to their list of trusted authorities. That way, the network can create whatever web domains they want and secure them with TLS.",2185

Bank A simply electronically transfers funds to Bank B and vice versa, as required. Banks do loan each other money though. The reasons for that are more complicated generally. Banks are required (by law) to maintain a certain money ""reserve"" in their accounts at the Central Bank in accordance with their deposits and loans. At certain times, banks may require more reserves and some banks have excess reserves of money. They will borrow from each other usually for very short periods (like overnight) just to maintain the required amounts.",1025

t3_nnvkjw,"Republic, 333a-e, how close does Plato get here to discovering the dual value of commodities in this passage?",gzxc8ff,"&gt;However, because the determination of value had never been discovered at this point, he seems to find it hard to see the mutual property between the horse and the money which would require the horse-seller to be truthful in his determination. After all, it would be entirely possible for a man skilled in horses but not in justice to properly know the value of his horse and deliberately give a higher price. Therefore in a purchase and sale, both the particular understanding of the object and an understanding of justice in general is needed, but this conclusion is not reached by Plato. I don't know anything about Capital - but I can't help throwing in a comment regarding reading Plato. I think you should pause to consider this question: What is more likely? It actually never occurred to Plato that someone could be dishonest and overcharge someone else. Or... Socrates is using a deliberately flawed argument to lead Polemarchus to a certain conclusion (namely, that justice is not worth very much, and it consists in lying and stealing) for a certain reason. \[It seems obvious to me that the latter is more likely. Indeed, I would argue that the whole crazy argument (which culminates in Polemarchus being forced to agree that justice is lying and stealing, the exact opposite of what his father Cephalus had asserted) is deliberately flawed and designed to highlight the way in which justice is not one art among others. Justice is normative and thus a ruling art, determining how the others arts should be used. That's the point you're led to, if you think through the ways in which the argument is flawed. The argument thus foreshadows the rule of the philosopher kings, who rule the other artisans in the city based on their knowledge of justice and goodness.\]",1779

For context although i love him profusely my old father will begin to scream and throw shit when he loses something or is irritated. Has done it since sixty no dementia present. to answer your question Ive tried comforting. Mostly I shut it down. like i don’t allow it to continue and i say stop this is ridiculous you can’t throw a tantrum and this is an abuse of my emotions. and that he needs to deal with his emotions and problems like everyone else . that honestly has worked. I’m not cruel when i say it but firm and understanding and i validate his emotions but not behavior. Then i help the situation like help him find the thing he lost. Beware this is a bit of an escalation and may agitate. I’m experimenting with different methods. In the future i’m going to try ignoring it and staring at him until he realizes what he’s doing bc honestly interfering and calming him down is a huge emotional toll on me. It’s less stress on me,977

t3_nos4dp,What is something traumatic or horrible that you saw/experienced as a child?,h01pi7z,"I don’t have any conscious memory of this, but I guess since I did witness it, it still qualifies here. So my parents are big in to rock climbing, and when I was young they’d often take turns watching me while the other climbed. Often the parent watching me would take me on a hike (they had one of those backpacks with a seat in it for a kid) to the top of the climb the other was doing so we could meet them at the top. When I was 2ish, my mom took me on a hike in NH to meet my dad and some friends at the top of a climb. There was a scenic overlook area nearby where lots of visitors took pictures, and near the edge there was a short rope with signs telling people not to go past that point as it was unsafe. There was a family of tourists up there that was speaking a foreign language, and likely could not understand the English signs. My mom and I watched as they stepped over the rope to get a better picture, with one of them staying back to take the shot. While I was watching the scene, smiling and waving as toddlers do, my mom was just thinking how best to communicate to them that they should come back over the rope. Before she could say anything, the woman taking the picture said something and gestured at the group, like she was repositioning someone in the photo. And in an instant, while we watched, one of the teenage daughters took a tiny step back and was gone. She just stepped back and dropped over the edge. My mom said she saw the look on her face for just a second, when she clearly realized what was happening but couldn’t do anything to stop it. Of course the family started screaming and crying. This was before cell phones, and the nearest ranger station was far away. In case she was still alive, they needed to get to her quickly. My dad and his climbing team had to climb over to check her, and when it was very clear that she was gone, they ultimately had to lower her body to the trail below. My mom tried to keep me from seeing any of the gruesome parts of course, but I saw her fall and I saw my dad after, covered in her blood. Apparently I had been relatively calm until I saw that, the site of him like that set me off.

Their point is that you should not be able to see through them or at least not very well. So transparent vails kind of defeats their point. The reason you can see features which is hidden under a vail is because these features deform the vail wherever they touch. The sculptors just need to make the vail lay as it would on a real person and these features will show. They do have the advantage of being able to put the creases where they want, adjust the posture of the person under the vail as they want and make the wind blow the vail in the direction they want which can exagregate this effect by allowing more features to show then normally. But they are still only shaping the stone to the vail and is not making the stone itself transparent.",785

That's not at all clear. You *can* always say that, but the strength of an inductive argument varies from case to case, and so the plausibility of the induction would vary from case to case. To make this more concrete: I've (verbally, not in print) argued in the past that we should almost certainly take various hypotheses relating to climate change (e.g., that it's caused by humans) to be even better confirmed than they seem to be because of how extraordinarily powerful the economic factors arrayed against accepting those conclusions are. (Similarly, I think there's a prima facie argument to be made that for a lot of people resistance to the science relating to GMO crops is rational given that GMOs benefit large food corporations and we know that large food corporation have in the recent past run disinformation campaigns to convince people that their products are healthier than they in fact are. Particularly for someone who doesn't have the time or training to go and read the scientific studies, it does seem to be rational to doubt that GMO crops are actually safe.) So, in other words, I think Lewens (or whoever else) could accept your argument and respond by pointing out that the economic interest argument you've made doesn't affect all scientific conclusions in the same way.",1492

t3_np23bb,ELI5: why air planes can't harvest wind power as a source of renewable energy and use less fossil fuel?,h02tw58,"Big commercial airplanes do in fact have devices to use wind power to generate electricity. This devices is called a RAT (Ram air turbine) and usually only used in emergencies when the normal power generation in the engines no longer works. They are not used during normal flight. The reason is simply physics. Yo need to burn fuel to propel your vehicle forward and if you siphon some of the energy of the air rushing past the vehicle to generate power you need to burn even more fuel. It is inefficient. Still a plane will continue to fly or at least glide forward and downward even after all engines are turned off and you can use a bit of that energy to power important parts of the plane, it will slow the plane down a bit faster than it would otherwise, but that is acceptable. Ships that use wind power have the advantage that they are inside the water and the air at the same time. planes are just in the air. A ship can use the friction of the water slowing it down as a counterforce against the air trying to push it forward. This is how sailing works. You can do similar thing with land vehicles sort of with land sailing, but it doesn't really work for much except as a novelty. If you want to achieve something similar for a flying vehicle you would end up with something like a kite or a balloon.",1310

Have like 20, 10 second interactions and then start going for actual longer conversations later on. You want to put yourself in a talkative mood. How the interactions go also depend on what you do inbetween interactions. Train your mind to see a win in every situation.

The only thing the tag tells you is the source material. How the fibers are threaded and how those threads are woven determine the fabric. Just as wool quality differs from sheep to sheep, so too does the processes of synthesizing polyester fibers yield different nuances and qualities. Once you have fiber, You spin it in some way to make thread or yarn. You then weave thread or yarn to make a fabric. There are dozens of different ways to weave threads. Consider dupioni vs taffeta. Both silk, but with very different properties. A felt flannel shirt is traditionally wool, which might be the same as your snug socks, but they are strongly differentiated by weave. Now consider a 3-piece suit, which is also wool, also very different. Look at say... denim jeans and a bedsheet. Both typically cotton. Etc. Anyway— hope that helps.",886

He told me I put the jack in the wrong spot and ended up getting the car lifted quickly.

One day I was in a different room than I was supposed to be, and this kid, who shall remain nameless (for obvious reasons) took it upon himself to throw a plastic pitcher at me and hit me right in the head. It shattered on impact and the whole class (about 15 of us) watched as all the water splashed onto me, drenched me, covered me, drowned me, held me under, etc. The whole class laughed, and laughed, and laughed some more at me. I ended up having a few chunks of dried blood in my hair for the rest of grade school. The last time I can remember getting so physically hurt was in first grade. There was this girl in my class by the name of Mary Sunshine. One day she sat in my seat. I didn't want to move, so I told her that it was my seat and I had sat there first. She just smiled at me and said that it was shared. We went back and forth on this for the rest of the day, and finally, when it was my turn to go before the teacher, I told her what was going on. She told me to tell the First Lady that it was my seat, and if she didn't like it to leave her class. Well, that was really pushing things, so when it was my turn to go before the lady she took me to the office and both of us had to stand in the hallway. She didn't even call my mom, she just took me to the office and had me and Mary Sunshine tell an adult what was going on. I don't remember why the First Lady didn't step in, but I do know that I was so glad when the bell rang to dismiss us. I had Mary Sunshine meet me after school for a long time afterward so I could tell her what happened, but I can't even remember anymore what we settled on. I do know that school was hell after that. The worst of all though was when Mary Sunshine exploded over the PA system. By herself. She sat next to me and proceeded to cry for the rest of the day while everyone made fun of me.

The head does a good job of dampening and deepening the voice you hear when talking. The rest of us however don't hear that ""inner"" sound, we just hear what comes out of your mouth.

t3_n3y3yi,"ELI5, Why do bike tires need 90-110 PSI, while much heavier cars tires need only around ~35 PSI?",gwtwzvj,"My truck has tires at 100psi. It's about weight and contact area. As others have said, PSI = pounds per square inch, and the force accumulates over the surface area. If you have a 12"" by 12"" plate in your hand and I magically exerted a downward pressure on that plate of 1psi, you'd feel a force of 144lbs. If I increased that to 35psi or 100psi you'd feel 5,040 and 14,400lbs of force respectively...on an object that's roughly the size of a sheet of paper. You can see that pressure adds up quickly over a surface area. In the case of a tire, that force is wrapped around the perimeter of the tire to balance itself out and keep it inflated, while the tire compound and belting are under heavy tension load. A bike tire at 100 psi has fewer square inches to develop force. A car tire has far more surface area and the resultant force of 35 psi is quite large. My truck tire is even larger than a car tire and it's at 100psi because my truck is massive and has a large towing capacity. The point here being that whatever portion of your car tire is currently touching the road has a force distributed over it that's equal to the weight on that tire. What you're balancing here is tire deflection. If I have a 100psi truck tire and inflate it to 35psi, it'll still hold my truck just fine, but the tire is a little squished down. If you look at one small ""pizza slice"" of tire from the rim out to the tread, as it rotates around it's one size, and then squished down when it goes over the road, and then stretches back out again. At higher speeds this squishing and stretching happens rapidly. Have you ever stretched a rubber band a bunch or some silly putty and then felt how warm it got? There's friction in the tire compound and it creates heat. Running underinflated tires causes them to heat unnecessarily from all the squishing and stretching, and if they're a little older they might already have small cracks in them and you're far more prone to blowouts. Tire pressures are determined by the strength of the compound, the surface area of the tire, the contact patch area with the ground, and the weight and speed of the intended vehicle. My offroad tires are *very* low pressure because I want as much contact patch area as possible. You're basically running on tires with a few puffs of air more than being flat. And they're great! But if you start driving at 90mph on those while towing a trailer, you'll blow them out. Similarly, if you have high pressure semi trailer tires and you try to offroad with them, your contact patch isn't nearly as good and you'll get stuck.",2583
t3_n40tax,"ELI5, Where did dating come from? Or the idea of dating in which you have to go out and do something with someone else to court them?",gwswn0d,"Dating can be seen as virtually any activity done between two people to spend time together. It can be going over to their house to watch a movie together, going hiking, going out to eat, going to play mini-golf, etc. The very act of ""people hanging out with each other and if they liked each other, great"" is a form of dating. Beyond that, many activities, like going bowling or something, costs money and is easier to coordinate if both people are going in the same vehicle. If you and someone else make plans to go bowling, for example, you *know* they won't be late if you go together in the same vehicle, you *know* exactly where they are instead of looking for them once you arrive, etc. It also allows people who have regular, busy lives, to set plans for a future date when they're both available. If you find potential partners/friends *only* by ""running into each other at some mutual location/event"", you're extremely limiting the people you meet and *also* putting a lot of faith in the random chance that you meet them again in the future, rather than specifying a *date* and time to see them again. I think the concept of ""a date"" being something where you specifically go pick someone up and take them somewhere specifically just to see if you like spending time together, is quite limiting on what a date can be. That is a type of date, but so is taking your spouse out for a meal at a nice restaurant.",1418

t3_n4h4y9,"ELI5: Why are some materials squishy, bendy, or more spesifically, malleable?",gwvktem,"There are many different specific reasons why a substance may be malleable. However, in general they all come to the ability for the atoms of that substance to move past each other without breaking the bond they have. One of the most interesting phenomena is the one you'll see in metals that can bend. We like to think of metals as one evenly spaced mass of atoms. However the truth is metals will form crystals within their structures. At the borders of these crystals there are bonds that are stretched and barely holding on. When you bend the metal, the force you are applying slides those crystals past one another, moving that stretched space along the mass of the metal until it reaches the edge. This is why if you bend a paperclip back and forth enough times you will snap it. You've accumulated enough of those stressed bonds at the edges that the mass can't hold together. Larger crystals in metal make less stressed bonds which makes that metal less malleable because the crystals can't slide past each other.",1021

t3_n5uj6c,"ELI5: What does the binary of a computer actually look like, and how does it understand those instructions?",gx3p5im,"The computer's brain thinks using two things: actions and items. This is its language. Items are things. Actions do things with items. They can modify items or they can use items to create new items. These items and actions are very small. The objects might just be a single letter or number. The actions will be something simple like: add or copy. The real trick is that we can represent all things with numbers. For example the value for the letter 'A' might be written as 01000001. However this could just as easily be the number representing the number 65 because 64 + 1 = 65. The computer's brain doesn't know or care about the difference. The actions are a lot like objects. They are also numbers. However the computer brain knows to treat them differently. Now, if we combine actions and objects we get instructions. An instruction is one action plus at least one object. Suppose we have two actions: COPY = 0000 0001 ADD = 0000 0002 Suppose we have a few objects: A = 0100 0001 B = 0100 0010 5 = 0000 0101 7 = 0000 0111 We could tell the computer things like: ADD 5 7 (0000 0001 . 0000 0101 . 0000 0111) We can even do ADD B 7 The brain can't tell the difference. The meaning of the objects above don't exist in the cpu. The numbers are just numbers. So, at the hardware level, objects and actions get loaded into the CPU as instructions. The action number gets put in a certain spot and the object numbers get put in certain spots. The cpu then activates. The wires connecting all three parts are designed in such a way that when the electricity has flowed through them, another object is created in a special place. Sometimes this makes a new object in an object spot, other times it just gets stored over an existing object. Then, the cpu deactivates and it loads the next action and objects. One of these objects even may be the result object of the last instruction. A computer's brain is doing this loop over and over again. Binary is used because it makes the wiring logic about as simple as it can practically be. (It's a lot simpler to manage whether electrical signals are low/high rather than low/middle/high) I highly recommend the book ""But how do it know?"". It has a silly title but it's by far the most approachable guide to how a cpu works that I've ever read. It's short and you don't need a math or CS education.",2338

This direction is a sum of the two forces pushing the boat. The same thing happens with waves. The way waves combine is to simply add the amplitude of the wave at every point. [The Wikipedia article for the superposition principle has more info, including a section on wave interference. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle) This is beyond ELI5, but there is no fundamental reason why the superposition principle should hold for all systems.

I'll copy paste my comment from then: Here is an excerpt from a paper: Materials in the mouth (food or saliva) and the cortical drive to the tongue and the submental muscles are necessary for initiation of VS. VS stands for voluntary swallow (as opposed to SS, the spontaneous one). I'd have to dig a little deeper to find you a mechanism. But it seems having something to swallow is necessary in addition to the cortical drive (your brain sending the order to initiate the sequential muscle contractions involved). And when you swallow once, you clear some of the saliva, conceivably dipping below the threshold required for the next swallow. This suggests the maximum rate of voluntary swallows depends on the rate of salivary secretion (and that depends on things beyond your control like what else is or has been in your mouth in terms of food and drink and also many other things like your autonomic activation with the sympathetic (fight or flight) or parasympathetic (rest and digest) nervous systems). However you will notice that if you try hard enough, you can induce a swallow anyway even if you just had one a few seconds back, but you'll also notice you're flexing some other muscles in your neck that actually stimulate salivary secretion, but this still poses a limit of the maximum swallowing frequency, because you can only force secretion so often in a minute.

I've had my hair short for about 8 years and been doing a number 0 with a trimmer for the last 4 or 5 and I'm blonde with fine hair so it looks like a clean shave. Also I'm doing an apprenticeship so I too work with some younger folk who all have full heads of hair. One of them was even amazed by me as she'd never spoken to a bald person before 😂 It's a big knock to your confidence I agree and it can take a while to overcome the embarrassment, but my advice is to just own it. Take the mick out of your lack of locks sometimes, be the first to crack that bald joke, tell people it makes you look like Jason Statham, The Rock, Bruce Willis. Try telling yourself how easy it is having no hair. No trips to the barbers, no sorting out your hair in the morning, wash your whole head with face wash, no dandruff (and if you do get dandruff, just moisturise that dome) no worrying if your hair looks alright and also, it makes you look like a geezer. It's pretty blokey having no hair. Hench bald guy with a beard = lady killer. I've seen studies, will try to find them for reference if I can, that have said how baldness is an attractive trait to a lot of women as it gives off signs of high testosterone, especially if you feel and look like you own it. Even if you're not owning it, act like you do and then after time you will. Young'ns always have questions about being bad that they will ask, just answer in confidence, act like you don't care and you'll own it.

t3_n72foe,What was your COVID experience like?,gxalb84,"I started my first full time salary job after graduating from college in February of 2020. A month later, the pandemic got to the US and altered a lot. I fortunately was never in any position to lose my job as the company produces plastic enclosures that medical companies buy (our top customer in 2020 was a producer for ventilators). But it disrupted my professional development there. Half of the office began working from home, but my position couldn’t allow it. During the initial lockdown, I was moved to work alone in the conference room. It was awful. Because the office was so small, I feel like for a good time I wasn’t being taught into work things over time. And with there being fewer orders, I began often running out of things to do. As a result, I started being more attentive to things that bothered me of other coworkers than my actual job and began going crazy overtime. I resigned in March because I had enough. So while that job drove me crazy throughout 2020, it kept me steady financially and I had a great amount in savings for me to have no issues leaving. Since I’ve resigned, I’ve felt great. The year has been a real learning year for me in a lot of ways, and that’s what I’ll take from this time.",1225

Place a random out of place object in a noticeable area. It could be a chair blocking the door or a water bottle on your bedside table. Place it there while thinking about whatever you want to remember. It doesn't even have to be related to the actual thing you're remembering. You'll look at it thinking ""Why the hell did I place it here?"" and then the memory will come back. This works especially well if you do it before bed or before you leave the house (but why would you leave the house?) since you'll forget about it until you see it again.",624

I was scared as I would be scolded for hours later so I tore the answer sheet into tiny bits and chucked it down in drain and prayed that my parents would forget that I received any kind of answer sheet and studied extra hard for other exams of math as school only puts best two out of three on the end of year report card. Another one - there was a computer exam the next day but my overconfident ass thought it was art paper so I studied art and around 9 pm I looked at time table again and shat concrete bricks. I kept it to myself and cheated my way out of the computer exam so I wouldn't get scolded when the results came, I got perfect marks on the art exam though.",855
t3_n72o3h,ELI5: Why does adblocker work on websites like YouTube but not on streaming services like Hulu?,gxahw5y,"Adblockers work on websites by analyzing URLs and HTML to spot the ads. There are only so many ad services, so it's easy to catalog and blacklist most of them. And for YT in particular, someone has figured out the URLs and HTML code YT uses for the ads so it can filter them out. YT could force ads if they chose, by delivering ads the same way they deliver the video, but they have not chosen to do this (yet). Adblockers don't work for streaming because it's not URLs and HTML, it's a video stream that's difficult for an Adblocker to analyze (the same reason it took a long time to have self-driving cars: computer vision is difficult). Also, most people don't stream from a web browser where an Adblocker can operate. If you're using a native app or a smart TV / streaming stick or box, then an Adblocker can't have access to the video stream anyway.",854

t3_n7357x,Why do anarchists object to representative democracy?,gxb8cyo,"Anarchism is typically defined as a political philosophy that opposes illegitimate and coercive hierarchies, and representative democracy very frequently (if not exclusively) falls under that camp of a problematic hierarchy, especially in today's world. Anarchist and more broadly leftist and Marxist analysis of societies that are described as representative democracies today rejects the view that these societies are genuine democracies. It is argued that these societies are under the domination of a capitalist class which through lobbying and other mechanisms ensures that the will of the majority is never represented by the alleged representation (such as through parliamentarians, congressmembers, presidents, etc). Marxists typically describe the state as an organ of class rule, but anarchists would go as far as to say that the existence of a state in any time period or form is symptomatic of a coercive hierarchy where one group of people have more power than another. Some anarchists might argue that a society could however democratically consent to a genuine representation, such as the election of an ambassador to represent an anarchist society in matters of international diplomacy. They could argue that such representation is not coercive and does not represent the kind of illegitimate hierarchy that should be opposed, especially if the ambassador does not wield any actual power over society. On the other hand, even if there were no corrupting influences and no capitalist class anarchists are typically still skeptical of vertical power structures and believe flat and horizontal associations in society are more morally justified or produce better outcomes. There is debate within anarchism about what constitutes an illegitimate hierarchy. Virtually all anarchists would agree however that societies that are typically defined as ""representative democracies"" today are thoroughly illegitimate.",1922

t3_n7htv9,What movie does everyone love that you think aged horribly?,gxcwumb,"The original _Star Wars_ isn't actually all that elegant of a production, and without the music and special effects it would be very weak as a drama (in fact Alec Guinness, who had starred in many classic films before becoming Obi-Wan, thought it was drivel), and relatively dull as an adventure. _Star Wars_ excelled because no one had ever done a picture like that before. It was viscerally exciting and mind-blowing, but only to people who'd never experienced anything like it. Other movies, shows, and games have since done a better job, and to modern audiences the original _Star Wars_, while undeniably a couple of hours well-spent, wouldn't make the same meteoric impact. That's perhaps a stretch to characterize as ""aged horribly,"" but certainly I think the film has fallen a great ways from its original height.

But I never knew whether these requests were from individuals or from facility leaders. We didn't ask, we just mailed masks to whoever requested batches of them and hoped they would be put to use as much as possible. I sewed a little, but by the end of the group when PPE manufacturers were catching up to demand and home sewists were burning out, I was managing sourcing and shipping materials to people that were sewing faster than I could. I mailed out every piece of cotton quilting fabric in my stash, invented a new faster way to make yarn from tshirts to use as mask ties when elastic was out of stock everywhere, asked my community for shirts and sheets and woven cotton fabrics that could be used as mask material, I worked my butt off and got giant packages of supplies to over 20 sewists and sewing groups. We didn't get much feedback for the masks we sent, only a very sincere thank you once in a while which was great motivation to sew faster lol. I don't blame people for not getting back to us, they're overworked and busy and exhausted. I just always wondered if the majority of the masks we sent were able to be used or not because they weren't technically up to safety and sanitization standards? We had guidelines to use only tighly woven cotton, publicly available mask research was slim back then but that was the best we could do out of the few articles we found, but I have no idea if that means they were able to hold up in an autoclave or not. I just really hope most of them were put to use, even if only once. Thank you for reading, stay safe!",1775

t3_n8bid0,ELI5 how do we measure the height of mountains?,gxigfw3,"Old surveyor here... Traditional methods (before GPS) would require using surveying instruments ([Transit or Theodolite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodolite#Transit)) to measure the required angles. The basic process is straight forward: 1. Establish a ***baseline*** \- a line between two points, both of which have an unobstructed view of the peak. Lets call these points ""A"" and ""B"", and the top of the peak ""P"". A&amp;B are usually far enough apart to ensure the peak is viewed from a significantly different angle. The length of A-B can be measured directly if the two points are directly visible from each other, or indirectly through a ""transit line"" ( a series of intermediate points where the distance/angles are measured along the transit line, and the A-B distance is subsequently calculated). Its not unusual for the baseline to be many km in length. 2. At points A &amp; B, measure the vertical and horizontal angles from the baseline to point ""P"" using the theodolite. The Theodolite is capable of measuring angles very precisely - down to the arc-second in modern instruments. 3. You now have a triangle where you know the length of one side (AB), and the horizontal angles PAB &amp; PBA. From this, you can derive the length of sides AP and BP via trigonometry. 4. You also have the vertical angles (the angle of the lines with respect to the horizon, or level line). With these vertical angles, and the distances, you can determine the *relative* elevation difference between points A, B, and P. 5. The last component, and the most difficult, is determining the absolute elevation (related to sea level) of either point A or B. This is accomplished by referencing some local benchmark whose elevation had previously been determined through a similar procedure as described here. That is, somewhere, there is a benchmark (monument) of known elevation (established through this procedure), that the surveyor must measure the elevation difference to - this benchmark might be hundreds of km distant. The surveyor must use the above process, multiple times if necessary, to measure to said benchmark in order to establish an absolute elevation. Also, the curvature of the earth can be compensated for during the calculation, and is required to do so if the distances are a few km or further. Old time surveyors were bad-ass! They had to haul large amounts of equipment over unforgiving terrain, sometimes for months, or even years, carefully making measurements and checking everything multiple ways to get an accurate survey. All in the middle of nowhere. There are many famous surveyors in history - including George Washington.",2648

Just a side story - not related to the topic, but anyway - When I again was at a big scoutcamp in 2012 I had my own phone - and the way we got power was that we had appointments at a tent where there were a bunch of excersise bikes. A few times a day, people from my group had to go there and bike for an hour. In return we could get our phones charged, by turning them in in a box - with the phones already connected to our chargers. So when we gave the box to some people, they would put our chargers in a cable - and using this power created with the biking to charge phones. Usually your phone only got to around 80% when they came back, but it worked.",944

t3_naubwu,"ELI5: Why does hot coffee that goes cold taste bad, but iced coffee or cold brew taste fine?",gxx4yp0,"long time specialty coffee barista here. ""specialty coffee"" is used to denote high-quality beans that are sourced directly from farms, not bought on the commodity markets. the roasters we worked with were extremely dedicated, and the product was often very different than what most people are accustomed to. a light-roasted high quality coffee should have a color like tea, a clean body (not thick!!!!!!!!), and a juicy, flavorful, sweet flavor. good coffee is truly more like tea than the coffee you'd get at starbucks or dunkin donuts, to the point that those latter drinks are almost unrecognizable as coffee to me. here's my point. if you're drinking GOOD coffee, it tests *best* at lower temperatures, somewhere between hot and room temperature when the flavors have had time to develop and it reaches a temperature that won't scald your taste buds. it will continue to taste good as it turns lukewarm and cool. so if your coffee tastes bad when it's cooler, it was never good coffee to begin with. as such, i cannot really answer your question, as the premise of the question (""hot coffee that goes cold taste\[s\] bad"") is itself flawed. but i'll try to answer somewhat. iced coffee that you get at many shops is simply yesterday's brewed coffee poured over ice. if that tastes good to you, then that's great, i'm jealous! at best, it's tolerable to me. i make no apologies for being a snob so save your breath if you want to call me out on it. cold brew makes good coffee because for whatever reason the low temperatures never extract some of the harsher notes from even low-quality coffee. i suspect that most places are doing a better job at filtering cold brew, because partly why warm coffee that goes cold tastes bad is due to unfiltered solids continuing to brew, leaving bitter/sour tastes.",1805
t3_natlz2,ELI5 Why do we get angry when we're hungry?,gxvmn5w,"Hungry is uncomfortable. It's unstable. You're not in equilibrium - something has to change. You need to change something to get you back into your stable happy place. When anything stops you, or slows you down, from changing the world around you to get what you need to get to your happy place -- the response is anger. You can change this, though. Not everyone gets angry when they're hungry. First, you can train your brain away from hunger meaning something is terribly wrong. Hunger happens, but food is available, and you *can* wait a bit and it's not dangerous to you if you don't eat for a little while. You can tone down the need to a want. Second, you can train your brain away from anger as a knee-jerk response. You can recognize hunger for what it is, and you can be aware of your temporary emotional state and pause a moment before lashing out. Diffusing anger takes time and effort.",897

Have you ever tried recording the voice of someone you know. You will notice that the recorded voice of that person and their voice what you hear directly whenever you are talking to them is the same... Meanwhile yours are not. It is because the voice you hear whenever you speak is a bit pitched. It is more ""mature "" or deeper. The reason behind this is this. You hear your own voice differently because it hits you directly. It comes from you and there are other paths within your head leading to inner ears where those voices of yours could very well travel.

Being charismatic is difficult and requires practice, learning, and constant improvement. Highly charismatic people aren't usually too dumb. But some people will get lucky and pick up charismatic traits unintentionally. These people make friends easily, but their charisma fades if they are not practicing and improving. It's pretty much just being able to quickly observe another person and respond in a manner that they would like most. This consists of emotional control, self awareness, laughing at others' jokes, and making jokes, being friendly without being disingenuous, finding common ground, being inquisitive or helpful at appropriate times, picking interesting topics of conversation, keeping good conversation rythm, and so on. These are all things that you can improve or get worse at depending on the type of person you want to be. Being likable and being someone whom others gravitate towards is a learned artform.

They hear a customer complain about one empty shelf and they just assume that someone is slacking. It doesn't even cross their mind that maybe the employee that was working that section is now working three other sections now, too...and instead of filling it themselves, they get on the walkie talkie and passive aggressively whine about how we're out of fucking Oreos and how customers expect there to be Oreos and really the whole store should stop what they're doing right now so that the Oreos are restocked. And then during the morning meeting they'll be like ""I know we're a little short staffed right now, but there's no excuse not to meet our customers' expectations. If you need help, reach our to your supervisors (even though we just laid off like 12 of them too)"". The lower our sales, the lower management's bonus, and that's literally all that management cares about.

To best describe what happens in a computer on a ELI5 way I think an analogy is in order. The tech savvy among you might cringe a bit, and yes it's not a perfect analogy. Let’s say you are a baker that makes cakes. You then get an order for a cake. You haven’t made this cake in a while, which means you need to order the ingredients (flour, sugar etc.). This can be compared to a program or data being loaded from the storage device (SSD/HDD), into the fast memory (RAM). This is a rather ""slow"" process compared to how fast computer processors has become. And this correlates perfectly with shipping being slow... The ingredients have now arrived, and you fetch the necessary ingredients of the shelves. This correlates with the processor fetching data from the fast storage (RAM), and this is pretty fast in both instances. You have all the ingredients and the recipe ready, so you start mixing the ingredients. The processor starts processing the calculations from the instruction set (code/recipe). The cake is all done so you send it to the one that placed the order, in computer term this might be your graphics card or RAM. If the same client wants another cake this will go really fast because you have all the data already loaded (ingredients pulled out). If, however the next order requires marzipan in addition you now have to order marzipan and get it shipped. Or maybe the workday is over (close the program), this is where computers is a bit different, it will then send the ingredients you got shipped back to your supplier. In other terms, get the data from the fast storage (RAM) and send it back to the slow storage (SSD/HDD) so it can be reused later.",1754

t3_ne28a4,What’s a book that helped you in some way?,gydzei6,"Rejection Proof - by Jia Jiang I've always let people's thoughts and opinions of my have too much power. It's kept me from standing up for myself, or asking for things I wanted. Should I ask out the pretty girl? Hell No! What if she says no? What if she laughs? What if I get judged? It affects other things too. Asking for a raise at work, or telling the waiter they got my order wrong. I just never liked being ""that guy"" and feared the social consequences. Rejection Proof is an awesome book that's all about forcing yourself into getting rejected. Throw yourself into weird situations and get used to the feeling so it doesn't seem as big of a deal. It's also cool how many wild things were actually possible when you just ask respectfully. Oh. And the book is down right hilarious. All around great read.",809
t3_ne5qt8,ELI5: using “royalty-free” beats for monetized YouTube video?,gyemthp,"While a royalty free licence can be sold for a one-time payment, the rights holders can also choose to grant that license free of charge if they so wish. The site terms, as you've described them here, seem to suggest that's what they offer.

They list some examples of pretty severe circumstances in which they would exercise this right, but in theory they could do so on a whim, and you'd potentially find yourself losing rights to your own work, or forced to pay royalties after all. Not trying to suggest they have any ill intent, but just something to be aware of - even if the current operators of the site are all honourable folks, who's to say it won't come under new ownership at some point?",993
t3_ne8sls,"Is it good to improve your character in and of itself, or is it good because of the consequences it produces?",gyf9s92,"I have a variety of philosophical thoughts on this, but how about if I start with the classic ""logotherapy"" approach of Viktor Frankl? He was in a sense more psychological or psychiatric, but at least in his most famous book he showed great attention to ethical issues. Anyway, he tried to find meaning with questions such as who might benefit from your own suffering or perceived failure. So here's a tentative answer for you: You don't need to change the world. Few people ever change the world beyond a small area, or a few friends and family. But in order for those few people to change the world, the laws of probability require lots of people to try and fail, and lots of people to want to do so but be unable to do so. So by building your character now, you're doing what people have always done to make positive change possible. And it's always possible that after some personal growth, or some transformation by future experience, you'll be the one to make something happen. I've read several things recently about transformational experience. Check out LA Paul, Agnes Callard, or JT Ismael if you're interested in that particular issue.

We went in and my buddy went to the kitchen and was looking around. I went and found the stairs. As soon as I hit the landing of the 2nd floor my flashlight went out.

You're not really supposed to point staple guns at students, are you? I also remember one time during test day, I was sick so I had to do it in the next science period. I sat down and place my laptop and school bag next to me and started to look for a pen. The teacher stopped me to ask what I was doing. I was about to say ""getting a pen"" but he interrupts me and told me to put my stuff at the front of the class. Everyone was staring at me because they had done the test and they were sitting at the front of the class in a circle doing some inane activity. I proceed to put my stuff at the front of the class and again start going through my stiff for a pen. This time, the teacher says my first and last name and again asks me what I'm doing but this time with a noticeably more forceful tone. I say that I'm getting my pen but this time I wasn't interrupted. He pauses for 2 seconds and then I quote ""How about you catch these hands in the parking lot after school, eh?"" I had NO IDEA how to react to that so I just stared at him like a deer staring at incoming headlights. Everyone in the room was silent and perplexed! They were probably as shocked as me.

I suppose you have to rebel, I know it sounds cliche, but some teenagers do it for a reason, you have a very good one. Set up basic boundaries you can hold, fight battles you can win, you tried rolling ovet and taking it - clearly didn't work. Apply double standarts, see which rules work both ways, and if they don't, call them out. Try winning ideological battles, and if they don't relent despite you proving a point, treat them as such, stubborn idiots. Keep a record of their bullshit, so if you're ever put on the spot you can lay it all out to a third party. Go to a school councelor, he's a grown up that is there to help, schedule visits, talk about it. Express your frustrations, this is a problem, your feelings are valid and you're no less of a human then they are. Act like it. Talk to friends about whatever, despite your parents listening, HOW ANNOYING THEY ARE AS HELLICOPTER PARENTS, HOW YOU CANT JACK OFF, I KNOW YOURE THERE MOM, GO AWAY! Anyway stacy is so hot right? WHAT MOM? YOU DON'T LIKE ME WANTING OTHER GIRLS? DO YOU ENVY OR WHAT? Don't be nice about it, push those walls they encased you in, make them work for it until it becomes more trouble than it's worth. Know there will be consequences, but not like you get what you want either way right? Prove to them that privacy is for both of your sakes, get caught jacking off, get caught talking shit, prove to them that it benefits both sides. Stalk around, when your patents are up to something in the bed, barge in with some bullshit excuse, and if they give you shit throw their dumbass reasoning back at them. Sell them that concept of privacy. Many more, but thats the fun of being a teen you're missing out on. Rebel against the system while the system is as basic as parents. You'll never be respected if you don't respect yourself and let people walk over you like that for free, parents or not. You'll never be treated as an adult when you act like a kid when treated like shit. Don't have to be a punk about it, you can be respectful in all of this, but respectful disagreement is not the same as quiet submission. Just rebel, don't put up with it. Don't take a beating for free even if you lose. Make them think twice, resist and exert your will, wishes and dreams upon the world. Vent out your anger, make them hear it. It will never happen if you keep it all inside. Release yourself from this, and allow yourself to be, you fon't need anyone elses permission for that. Keeping still and quiet only serves these chains that bind you. Honest communication is between two consenting adults, what you have here is nothing worth saving, your parents see you as inferior, they wouldn't dare do this to any other adult human being. But it's not only them that got deluded in all this, you let it happen. Good luck.",2933

t3_ng9a54,Why do philosophers take common sense (so) seriously?,gypokgq,"I don’t think philosophers think there’s any property of beliefs called ‘common sense’ that exists over and above plausibility. By ‘common sense’ a philosopher typically just wants to commend a view for being plausible. With that said, a lot of the time philosophers will talk about intuitions, and there’s a lot of debate about the role of intuition in philosophical methodology. One thing to be said is that lots of philosophers, Capellen and Williamson, for instance, do not think that intuition plays any particularly important or central role in philosophical theorising. Williamson, for instance, thinks that philosophy progresses more or less by developing better and better models (and by this he means mainly formal semantics.) Similarly, Jennifer Nado makes a very strong argument, in my opinion, against talk of intuitions as a monolithic group of cognitive processes that are equally reliable (published as ‘Why Intuition?’) Now, when you say that all scientific discoveries proved common sense to be misguided, I’m not entirely sure what you mean. No philosopher just works from a single intuition alone and builds a theory. Philosophers will consult intuitions at different stages of arguments alongside many other theoretical parameters (for instance, assessing the consequences of the theory, its empirical backing and so on). So to suggest that all scientific discoveries show that intuitions are misguided is a very naive view of how intuitions are consulted both in reflection and in everyday practice. A huge amount of natural science is deeply intuitive, except perhaps when we get down to the quantum scale. But the proofs and evidence that lead us to unintuitive consequences are themselves intuitive enough for us not to reject them for being absurd. I’m also not really sure what you mean by people creating common sense beliefs, as far as I’m concerned no one does this, especially not in philosophy. I do agree with the general point that intuitions cannot be used as raw data for a philosophical theory because we can’t just talk generically about the reliability of different peoples intuitions. However, how is this a problem for the philosopher, who does have common sense beliefs and is deeply reflective about them? Anyhow, if you just google intuitions and philosophy there’s a huge amount of literature on this (I recommend checking out SEP). There’s not really a philosophical consensus on the roles of intuitions so it is, to some extent something which is best to assess on a case by case basis when analysing arguments",2557

This was the late 1970s or early 1980s, so there were no cell phones. Well, the car died, and he rolled over to the side of the road. There was a farmhouse there. He popped the hood -- he was no mechanic -- and looked at the battery, moving one of the cable connectors. Something arced and the battery exploded. He was yelling for water, as he got battery acid in the eyes. I was around 9 or 10 or so, and we didn't have drinking water in the car, but we had an empty bottle, so I went to the farm house, and no one was home.

But it's not fair to hold his past experience/s over your relationship together. For instance, my current partner hasn't had as many LTRs as I have. It would ruffle my feathers a bit if he was to turn to me and say ""I can't believe you've had x number of serious relationships, I'm obviously nothing special"". Like, no, my past experiences are in the past for a reason. I don't want to be with them anymore, and never again. I want to be with him. I'm pretty damn certain your SO feels the same about you. Ultimately, however, you need to consider your options here, because this is going to eat away at you, I feel.

t3_nhjuyl,ELI5: What does p-value mean?,gywtixc,"Short version: p-values help distinguish noise from real effects in statistical data. If you have a question to investigate, say ""Do cats cause headaches?"", then you might want to collect some data or setup a study. So, let's say you get together a hundred people and then assign some of them cats and some of them other pets like dogs or rabbits to compare. Because you've regularly asked participants about if they've had headaches and how bad they were you can now compare rates of headaches among your pet owners. Let's say you found that cat owners had headaches 20% more often. Here's the issue: 20% more doesn't mean anything in and of itself, because with a hundred people, just due to random variation or noise in the data, you could easily have some characteristic show up 20% more often in one sub group compared to another. So, if you came out and just said, ""Look, cats cause headaches!"", somebody else might try to replicate your study with a thousand or ten thousand people and find that there's no relation between rates of headaches and cat ownership at all. p-values help solve this problem. In this case, calculating the p-value would tell you how likely it would be to get a 20% increase in headaches or more, just due to random variation, without any true underlying cause. The lower the p-value, the more confident you can be that your data isn't just the result of randomness or noise. In general, a p-value tells you the probability of getting the results you got, purely due to noise. Side note: p-values only correct for the number of samples taken. Many other factors can affect the true strength of your data. So, you could have a low p-value but still really be measuring noise if your study design or experiment design is poor in other areas.",1772

t3_niivsc,When should you not be honest?,gz23qw3,"**Conversely to the first comment here, I'd say it's never a good idea.** Remember you don't have to blurt things out, just say nothing or directly say you're not comfortable discussing things people might interrogate you about. If you've done something wrong, own up and explain on your own terms instead of evil people adding lies and rumours on top of what you actually did! Being honest doesn't mean being idiotic, bear in mind. I get by with milder terms like for example a terrible meal being ""definitely not to my taste"". If you say something positive about something that was terrible, I find they'll just do it again. Of course I've made people angry because they were begging for flattery while pretending to ask a real question, but those types of people aren't worth associating with and often witnesses are relieved by you saying what they were all too afraid to say themselves. At work and in social situations, I am strongly trusted and sometimes directly sought out for advice because they cannot ask anybody else for the truth. TL;DR: The pros outweigh the cons.",1079

Looked down and saw a hand holding a phone sticking out from under the toilet stall next to me, with the camera pointed up at me. I turned a little and aimed my pee stream towards him and soaked his hand and phone. He screamed ""Oh God!"" And dropped the phone. I kept pissing on it while he tried to pick it up and dragged it back into the stall. He wouldn't come out of the stall after so I washed up and left the restroom, just to stand right outside and wait. When the camera man finally came out it was a middle aged dude in a nice suit. He was obviously upset that his arm was soaked in urine, and got even more upset when I yelled ""Pervert!"" As he tried to hurry out of the store.

I'd wake up in the mornings to weird trails across my carpet, which I told myself must just be damp even though I knew it looked a lot like slug trails. One night, I got home from a pub trip slightly worse for wear, flopped on my bed and was asleep before my head hit the pillow. A few hours later, still some time before dawn would peek through my window, I woke up with the beginnings of what I could tell would be an almighty hangover. I knew from experience that my best hope of being good for anything the next day was to drink a pint of water and try to sleep it off as much as possible, so I resigned myself to heading to the kitchen, and reached down to turn on my bedside light with the switch that was on the floor. The light comes on. I look down. Still drunk. Banging headache. I see, a couple of centimetres from my hand, the biggest fucking slug I've ever seen. I've never been able to look at a slug since without a shudder, and I'll genuinely go out of my way to not get too close to one",1064

t3_niwtso,[Spider-Man] Do people generally listen to the Daily Bugle?,gz48t54,"The Bugle is often derided as a tabloid, but that might just mean they use tabloid formatting on the front page (plenty of respected publications use those). We've had a few characters compare it to Fox News, in a manner that suggests that its reputation for sensationalism and, on certain issues, biased slant, is well-known. However, in the interests of even, balanced discourse, Jameson does allow sort of a counterpoint segment in the newspaper that provides alternative takes on various superhero-related news (I don't know if it's currently running, but when it was it was called The Pulse and was written by Jessica Jones). JJ is also widely known in the journalism world for his coverage of the civil rights movement back when he was a cub, and that coverage was apparently fair, balanced, even unusually positive for its time, so it's not like every Bugle headline is the exact same thing. When Dexter Bennett bought the paper from Jameson, it was treated as a huge drop in quality and integrity for the paper, to the point that many people including Peter didn't even want to work there anymore.",1105

Also - the movie/book see a random girl on the street so you must go talk to her and instantly go for coffee is mostly fantasy; romantic relationships are something that usually grow over time. this doesnt mean months or years but usually at least a couple weeks of casual interaction. romantic relationships are just like regular relationships - you have to have things in common you have to have established contact. The first thing you should do is work on your verbal and non verbal communication. Tell yourself TALKING TO THIS GIRL WILL NOT LEAD TO A DATE/ROMANCE.

With in a month of us buying our dog decided it was a chew toy. The top of it is ripped to shreds and unrecognizable anymore. When my dad died I fought to get the walking sticks. Over the years they got progressively more expensive, progressively more artistic and interesting. We kept buying them, at least 2 a year, until I was 16, so there is 25 of them. Some are glass, some have hidden compartments, some are intricately carved. Theres even one made out of marble. They are displayed in a stand by my back door, and I look at them with fondness tinged with melancholy all the time.

t3_nk481j,ELI5: What prevents us from seeing source code in closed source software?,gzatia8,"No, the source code is more like a recipe which *creates* the app code which is needed for the program to function. The source code is all laid out in a logical, human-designed and human-readable format, and then a compiler turns that into a much tighter, optimized, machine-readable version of the algorithm which is described by the source code. This machine readable version is called, appropriately, machine code. There do exist programs called decompilers, which can go the other direction and give you source code from a piece of machine code. But a decompiler isn't just like ""Give me *the* source code this was compiled from."" It's more like ""Give me *a* source code which, if compiled, would produce this machine code.""

Since there is no real answer that I'm aware of, perhaps my speculation is a valid response. I think it might have to do with the fact that a child at that age is experiencing SO much, it's ALL new. So between the early ages, say 2 years old, and asked at 3 if they remember something from 2, they might say yes, but at 5, maybe not? It makes me wonder if they just aren't really used to reflecting on things, because they are constantly taking in new stuff.

I would go as far as to say that everyone SHOULD question their relationship before marriage. It's a big step and not because you now have to decide on what kind of wedding you want, if you even want one. A few things that I questioned was: -Is this person mentally/emotionally stable, if not, am I willing to put up with/work through these issues with this person?and are they willing to do the same. -Are we improving each other's lives or detracting from it? What do I want to get out of this marriage with this person that I love. What do they want? -What does this person's debt/credit score look like? If it's shitty and they have a lot of debt, am I willing to take half of their debt and pay it for them? Because your debt is now theirs and theirs is yours. -and which head am I thinking with? The one with the brain or the one that makes me horny. One makes sense and the other makes us dumb. Marriage isn't just love, there's a lot of logic, planning/coordination, patience and understanding, mandatory discussions and disagreements. Marriage isn't just love, it's work, its hard work. Day in and day out with no breaks. Don't get me wrong, I love my wife, she is amazing. But we do have the occasional argument, which is normal. Once you find the groove that works for you and yours, things start clicking and everything works. I would not change getting married at all.",1447

As simply as I can put it, a memory occurs when your brain reactivates neurons in your head the same way they were activated when that event actually happened. What you sensed, what you felt emotionally, all recreated to remember what happened! (Again, as SIMPLY as I can put it) Activating neural pathways reinforces them, making them less susceptible to being lost, since your brain is constantly rewiring itself and creating new neural connections, (again, in a SIMPLE sense) Trying to recall a memory can take some time for your brain to connect all the dots, and light up the pathways that have since been weakened. Trying ""harder"" can certainly make a difference, but really what you are doing is minimizing distraction long enough so that the memory can get resparked",850

Got ready again and started heading out. We paddled around for maybe 15 minutes before deciding to actually go down. We’d heard there were sharks in a nearby beach a few days earlier so we were all on the look out. Dropped down to about 10 metres and saw something glimmering probably 6 or 7 metres further down. Anyway we came up for some air and talked about it and figured we should go investigate. So took a deep big breath and got half way there because we couldn’t quite make it. Holding your breath drunk is really hard. After a couple attempts we gave up and went back to shore waiting for the ride to go out a little further. Just on sunset when it was a bit lower we headed out again. Finally managed to get down there and it was glimmering bright as hell. On closer inspection it was a waste of your time and was an astronaut in the ocean and now I’m going to type some words so that that word isn’t so obvious. Cheers",1271

t3_nlfe4f,"ELI5: Why are programmer salaries still so high, when there is no system to control the number of programmers in the market?",gzi81nw,"Simple, the barriers to entry are just not that low. *Coding*/*programming* (whatever you want to call it) isn't *that* hard. Being a good software developer is hard, and takes a lot of time and a lot of effort. There are whole project management philosophies to become experienced in, there's the art of setting objectives, scopes and requirements, there's version control systems to master, collaboration techniques to learn, the ability to review people's code quickly and effectively. I wouldn't trust someone with a 2 month bootcamp qualification to immediately write clean, reliable, efficient code - that takes years. For an example, take one of my most intelligent friends who's also a programmer. (Top of the class at a top university kind of guy). The company he now works for literally told him when they hired him (and he had a lot of experience programming during his PhD) ""We don't expect you to be functionally useful or deliver anything significant for at least 6 months"". Sure, he could write decent code from day 1, but there was no way he would be unleashed onto the core code and be trusted to develop that software further without a lot more experience. There is so much more to being a programmer than coding. Also, if a company wants someone to just write a chunk of code which is functionally easy to define (e.g this block of code takes data from this source, runs this algorithm on it, and spits out the results like this) - then there are a lot of outstanding programmers in India who you can outsource that work to for a lot less than employing someone in the US.",1591

It is also worth mentioning that a lot of the plastic waste in the oceans are from boats.

t3_nmcunq,"ELI5: When you convert an MP4 to a GIF, why does the file size often become larger?",gznwnii,"Video compression is based on the fact that most of the time the next image in a video is a slight modification of the previous. The result is that you start with compression of a complete frame and only store the difference to the next. The difference can include stuff like that part of the image moved in that direction a number of pixels. When the difference is large enough or if some set amount of free you restart with a new frame you compress from scratch. This is a lot more efficient than compressing each frame separately. That said animated GIFs are not a sequence of GIF images. It stores the difference from the previous frame but the way the difference is stored is not as complex as for MP4 and the result is larger files. The audio is a small part of the video so how efficient is compress the video part is a lot more relevant This is for real GIF, Today most GIF files are not really GIF files often it is WebM with a .gifv extension. The video format is VP9 if I am not mistaken. If it really is GIF the video only has 256 colors and will be a lot larger. So the explanation that it gets a bit larger is because you recompress a compressed video and even compressing to the same format results in a larger video. Different compression standard are have different efficiency It can also be a question of the setting of the program. You can spend more time and compress it to a smaller file with the same format.",1430

They swapped billionare with bottom feeders, let the rich do the basical job, on the lowest salary, to see how far the rich could go by purely their own effort. Nearly all of the billionare admitted that they could not make anywhere, regardless of how hard they worked, even working without sleeping and resting could not give you any accumulation to help climb up to the higher level of the society. There was only despair, and admission that the divide between the poor and the rich is already a deep valley and mere personal effort makes little sense. It stirred big debate among the society back then, and I think that was part of the reaons the show got cancelled . There was also another show in China, swapping senior political figures with community level council workers, to see how good they could do in each other's posts.

Both were for high school technician posts in the UK. One guy showed up wearing bicycle clips, a cape, and a hat with earflaps. He did remove the hat, but only when I firmly suggested it. During the interview told an irrelevant and very long story about his mother's pernicious anaemia instead of answering the question about his job history, and then gave us a lecture about diesel engines (also irrelevant). I didn't dare look at my fellow interviewer for fear of breaking into hysterics. He phoned for feedback on finding he hadn't got the job, which was an awkward conversation. That was the most bizarre. The other was a really nice guy, in his late 40s maybe, early 50s? Good job history of various manual posts. Interviewed really well, great verbal skills, was personable and completed the practical tasks brilliantly. Then the reading and writing task came up, and he just said no. It was simple ordering from a catalogue. I thought maybe he didn't want me to watch, so I went and made tea and left him to it, but he wouldn't even attempt it. Didn't even open the book. I think he couldn't read. When I looked at his application form, it looked as though it had been written by a teenage girl, and he had mentioned teenage daughters. Really sad.

Of course, as with most writing advice, none of that matters if you've got the fucking juice to pull it off. If you write exposition as well as John Cheever, and it's fucking scintillating to your readers, then prologue away--but part of learning to write is learning how to accurately and honestly assess your strengths and weaknesses.

t3_nobik4,ELI5: What causes increase in saliva during running?,gzzmlgi,"So, the study you linked actually DID find an increase in saliva flow rate with exercise, but that was in CONTRAST to previous studies that had found saliva flow to be *decreased* or *unaltered* by exercise. (The water component of saliva is normally secreted during RECOVERY / non stressful type stimuli, aka your parasympathetic nervous system, while proteins such as amylase in saliva are normally secreted during STRESSFUL type stimuli, aka your sympathetic nervous system.) Since they weren't expecting that, and it wasn't the main objective of their study, they weren't really ready with an explanatory discussion of that result. The best they gave was that the exercise environment was kinda cold (10 degrees Celsius, which is 50 degrees Fahrenheit) which could have stimulated saliva flow, and that they were exercising in that relatively cold room for only 20 minutes and ""under these circumstances dehydration is expected to be limited."" Usually, the general explanation is that it's not so much an increase in saliva as it is an increase in the THICKNESS (viscosity) of your saliva, which feels uncomfortable in the mouth, and so we are more aware of it and more motivated to spit than usual. The increased viscosity is usually thought to be caused by the dehydration of your oral tissue from evaporation during heavy mouth breathing, but the study you linked above shows an alternative explanation, which is the increased production of MUC5B - a mucus-making protein - during exercise. (They noted that this was counterintuitive, since MUC5B is usually secreted during parasympathetic response, aka recovery and not stress, but again since this was an unexpected result they don't have a super strong explanation for it yet.) The purpose of mucus is to catch unwanted matter in your airway and glom onto it, so that it can more easily be moved along up and out of your airway (ideally cough it out). There is mucus in your lower airway, which is super important for protecting it, but your salivary glands also produce mucins (mucus-making proteins) as well. The study you linked above found that when you exercise, your salivary glands make much more of multiple different proteins, so the protein concentration of your saliva goes up. This is probably due to your glands being stimulated by substances that get released in your body during stress (exercise is definitely stress, to your body). One of those proteins is the mucin MUC5B, one of the guys that determines how viscous (thick) your saliva is. This study found that MUC5B concentration increases with exercise, which is another explanation for the increased viscosity of your spit and therefore the need TO spit. Tldr: it's more that the viscosity increases and makes you feel the need to spit it out. New evidence suggests flow may also increase but not super clear on why yet.",2852

Even if the amount of salt inside the cell stays the same, the amount *outside* the cell also matters: if the fluid around the cell is saltier or less salty than the cell itself, the cell can dangerously shrink or swell as water flows through the cell's membrane toward the saltier side. Living things have different ways of keeping the right amount of salt in their body, but they're tuned for the environments they live in. For instance, humans' urinary systems help keep the proper amount of salt in the body if they eat or drink most things, but they're unable to get rid of enough salt to survive if a human drinks nothing but seawater. Similarly, most freshwater fish aren't suited for keeping salt out of their body if they swim in sea water, and most salt water fish can't keep enough salt *in* their bodies if they swim in fresh water.",1145

The younger (physiologically) vamps being able to change with the times and duck the hunters. Likewise those vamps with more flexible minds might see where the winds blow and adjust their public facing beliefs accordingly. Now what they believe personally might vary greatly.

t3_n2vpuv,Is the concept of 'Dao' in Daoism comparable to 'Brahman' in Hinduism?,gwmy8eb,"Hi there! Daoism is my main area, and I know less about Hinduism. So I'll briefly tell you about Dao and hopefully you will be able to see if it is comparable to Brahman. Dao does not transcend the world, and it is not 'above' the world in any sense. This is true even though classic texts frequently describe Dao as the 'mother' of all phenomena (the *wanwu* or 'ten thousand things'). How can that be? Well, the best metaphor I like to use for Dao is 'ecosystem'. Picture a tree. What enables it to grow and flourish? In Daoism, the tree (like all of the *wanwu*) has a latent, inner potential (called *shi* 勢). What enables the tree to reach that potential though? Well, the rain is one thing that helps it grow. But it’s a lot more than that, isn’t it? There is a whole combination of phenomena involved: the soil quality, the worms and other insects in the soil, the evaporation that forms the clouds that make the rain, and of course the sunlight. There are a lot of phenomena involved in making the tree grow, and they form an *interconnected ecosystem*. Dao is like this. Dao is the interconnected ‘ecosystem’ of the entire universe. It is not any individual part, but the pattern of the whole. Dao is the *system itself*. This is why it is not 'above' or 'transcending' phenomena. It is the dynamic system formed amongst phenomena interacting with each other. Take me, as an example. My ‘mother’, cosmically speaking, is not just the actual woman who gave birth to me. It is the food and drink I consumed, the upbringing I received, the relationships around me, the events I participated in and the things I encountered. All of these things nurtured me, made me grow, and made me continuously transform. And all of those things, as an interconnected system, are Dao. This is what Laozi meant when he says Dao is his mother. There is a lot more to say, but I hope that provides a starting point of comparison with what you know about Brahman.",1950

t3_n2w06a,ELI5: Why are free electrons able to move around an entire object?,gwqm3q9,"Electrons are able to move around objects when the force from the nucleus holding onto the electron is overcome by some external force. When the outermost electrons are held loosely enough by the nucleus, [they will move between atoms when subjected to an electrostatic or magnetic force.](https://www.edinformatics.com/math_science/why-do-electrons-flow.html#:~:text=When%20a%20negative%20charge%20is,a%20conductor%20electrons%20are%20repelled.&amp;text=When%20electric%20voltage%20is%20applied,move%20toward%20the%20positive%20side.) A full explanation of this must start with defining the atom. [This Northwestern University physics document defines atoms as the building blocks for everything in the universe](https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/students/science-101/what-is-an-atom.html). They are sphere-like in shape and are made up of three smaller subatomic particles.[ Protons and neutrons make up the center of the sphere called the nucleus and the electrons fly around outside the nucleus in a sort of cloud.](https://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/projects/vss/docs/Propulsion/1-what-is-an-atom.html) A common analogy is that electrons float around the nucleus of an atom kind of like vapor droplets in a rain cloud, moving around in space while staying within the cloud itself. [The big difference between electrons and the other subatomic particles is that they are free to move around outside the nucleus](https://www.britannica.com/science/electron), which makes it easier for them to move from atom to atom. Electrons are able to move when they “break free” from the nucleus that was holding in the cloud. The only reason that they are able to do this, is because of an outside force influencing them. [Much like a moth is attracted to a flame](https://www.physicscentral.com/explore/action/dressed-to-impress.cfm), an electron is attracted to the opposite charge, typically the protons in the nucleus. But as this accredited textbook talks about, [when the attraction force to the protons of another atom is stronger than the attraction to an electron's own nucleus, the other atom will pull the electron away from its atom.](https://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/estatics/Lesson-1/Charge-Interactions) This will happen when a positively charged piece of metal moves close to a neutral piece of metal, some of the electrons in the neutral piece will be pulled toward the positive piece. The outside force of the positive piece allows for electrons to move around the neutral piece because it is greater than the force of the nucleus trying to hold onto the electrons. To further visualize this, see the link attached below. This concept can also be visualized by imagining there is a dog leashed to a tree. Left alone, the dog might simply be bored, walking or standing around the tree in any random location. In this scenario, think of the dog as the electron, the tree as the nucleus, and the leash indicates how tightly bound the electron is to the nucleus. As of now, the dog is free to move around the tree as he pleases, but if he were to smell a steak at the next tree over he would be immediately attracted to it. He would want to run in that direction as if the steak was a positive charge. If the dog's attraction to the steak is stronger than the leash holding him back, he'll break away from his tree and run to the next tree over. The same applies to electrons, they are attracted to opposite charges and when that attraction overcomes their attraction to the nucleus they break free.",3516

Then Vince McMahon Jr comes along with his cartoon wrestling in the 80's, took advantage of the money and position he inherited from his old man to run every other promotion out of business and made pro wrestling more and more of a joke with every passing decade. Now, the public views pro wrestling as ridiculous and even the people getting into pro wrestling seem to think all you have to do is some silly flips and comedy routines to succeed as a pro wrestler. It's a business that's went from being respected to viewed as a complete joke even by the so-called fans who really just want to see whatever ridiculous stunts the wrestlers will pull on each show and do their ""HOLY SHIT!"" chants and who have no interest in seeing any actual wrestling.

He very much missunderstands what toxic masculinity is, and somehow believes that wanting to protect and provide for someone is toxic. It is not. Toxic masculinity would be expecting the woman to do the dishes and cook dinner alone, to expect her to obey your every wish since you provide. People think women do not want to be provided for/taken care of, but the truth is that BOTH GENDERS would appreciate someone who'd want to take care of them, especially emotionally.

t3_n46mno,Who is the greatest Pokemon Trainer to ever live?,gwtvwf6,"I think it depends how you define ""greatest"". Ash is certainly not the strongest trainer. But he does have a legendary degree of kinship with Pokémon, and often seems destined or fated to interact with (and save) all the legendary Pokémon and mythical Pokémon in the span of a year (going by BS anime aging). Lance and Cynthia are probably two of the *strongest* and most well-known trainers, and could be classed as the ""greatest"". Beyond that, you're looking towards someone who strikes a balance between Pokémon treatment, knowledge, skill, and renown. On that end you'd probably be best looking towards someone like Brock who has good Breeding experience (not in *that* sense) as well as being well-travelled and quite skilled in battle, Misty who is much the same but with Pokémon/human aquatic shows, or May/Dawn who are likewise but with Pokémon Contests. Personally, I would go for probably Ash or Cynthia. Ash has a lot more MC plot power granting him meetings with the legendaries where he proves his worth consistently (even managing to stop assholes like Mewtwo from being assholes!), and he embodies the drive of a passionate trainer to always be better and improve. He isn't infallible as he often loses, but his skill is still pretty top notch. Cynthia is much the same, but with a definitively more horrific show of power to back up her claim to being the greatest. I could have restated Lance, but I feel Lance lacks a bit of empathy which could cement him as the greatest. There are a bunch of other notable mentions, but because they're all flawed in some significant way, I wouldn't choose them. Gary Oak is the poster child for egotism, Stephen Stone is a bit limited with his type coverage, N is extremely idealistic and philosophical to the extent that he essentially lost his way until he was humbled, and Leon has an extremely short attention span and sense of direction (in addition to his egotism being on par with Gary's, albeit friendlier).",1969

The first and only thought of nihilism is ""everything is meaningless"", and that's it. How can you decide something is positive or negative if you don't believe in a valid value metric? The term ""optimistic"" is not about the concept but rather the attitude to that concept. Why do you name object A based on the essences of object B? Do you classify ""mudering knifes"" and ""cooking knife"" if they are basically the same knife? But you do distinguish ""a murderer"" and ""a chef"". So in my view, it's kinda dumb and ironic to classify nihilism. You can say when a person ""positively"" approach nihilism, he or she is doing it with the attitude of absurdism. But making a new kind of nihilism to address absurdistic ideas is weird.",832

t3_n48s5t,ELI5: why is ceramic useful as body armor when ceramic mugs shatter really easily?,gwu5t85,"1) Material. The ceramic they use in mugs are often made of clay material, terracotta, porcelain, that kind of things. While ceramic armor are made of material like silicon carbide and such. Even if both are ceramic, they don't have the same proprieties. It's like comparing bronze to steel, both are metal, but that don't act the same way. 2) Size. Pottery are often thin, while ceramic armor can weight up to 8 pounds and their thickness is measured in inches. The more material you have the more it can survive stress. The same reason why a bullet will go straight through your windows at home, but will be stopped by an inch of glass. 3) You are right that ceramic seem fragile, but that doesn't really matter. When a bullet hit the ceramic it will shatter it into small pieces, but that's the point. All the force of the bullet will go through all those fractures and dissipate the force. The ceramic will be useless after that, but the job is done. Now well done ceramic plate is made like a sandwich with different material so that the ceramic plate don't get destroyed in one shot. They try to achieve a balance with different layer, so the ceramic shatter to dissipate the impact, but the shattering is limited by the other layer to a small area, so that the plate can survive more than one impact.",1307

t3_n4yv87,"Did the Stoics believe that, although we cannot choose what happens to us, we can decide how it affects us?",gwybwca,"You don't choose what happens to you (e.g., you don't *choose* whether you get punched in the face). You do choose how something affects you (e.g., you *do* choose whether you interpret being punched in the face as bad) but your choices are determined. That's why Epictetus says in the *Discourses* that god made us into the sort of people who choose X or Y: &gt; For god himself made me such as to select those things. But if I knew for sure that it was fated for me now to be ill, I would even seek [illness]. For my foot, if it had brains, would seek to be muddied. The fact that the Stoics often make it seem like our choices are un-determined got them into a lot of hot water in antiquity. This was more the case with the Greek Stoics, especially Chrysippus, who reportedly wanted to have it both ways (i.e., hold both that everything is determined and that somehow our choices were not determined) than it is with the Roman Stoics, such as Epictetus. So much scholarly ink has been spilled trying to make sense of the Stoic theory of freedom and responsibility in the face of their determinism that it is truly impressive! When I teach the Stoics to undergrads, this is always the biggest stumbling block. I do think that Chrysippus came up with a coherent way out of dilemma but it is tough to explain. People like Epictetus are much clearer that even our choices are determined. The most important thing you can remember is that even in a deterministic worldview, we still choose things. We choose things as much as we raise our arms, go to sleep, etc.: all of these things still happen, but they're determined.",1619

t3_n57s2t,ELI5: Why is taylor swift re-recording her albums?,gwzuxim,"She signed over the rights to her future 6 albums to Big Machine Records, her record label, when she was 15. She made those 6 albums, then left. She wanted to purchase her albums, but they refused - the only deal they would make was for her to ""earn"" one old album for every new album she turned in. Then the rights were sold to Scooter Braun, who Taylor has beef with - for one thing, he was Kanye West's manager at the time Kanye commissioned a wax figure of Taylor's naked body for a music video, something a manager would be involved in. He also bragged about ""buying"" Taylor Swift. Obviously, she wasn't pleased, and refused all licensing offers (for use of her songs in TV, film, etc) - ensuring that Braun would only make money from streams and sales, which are pennies compared to licensing deals. This also meant that she wasn't making money from licensing deals, and it also meant that her music wasn't being used in other media, something she wanted to happen from an artistic standpoint. So she's re-recording all her old work, so that her new versions can completely replace the use of the old ones. They're similar enough that no movie producer is going to care if they get the new one instead of the old one, and since it's their only option, they will. Much of why she's re-recording is to make a statement - many of the songs she's re-recorded will never be licensed, but she wants to COMPLETELY own her work. It's at least as much a creative decision as a business one. Her disagreement with her record label is a) them not letting her purchase her catalog, b) them selling her work to Scooter Braun (for the reasons named above), and c) them stifling her creatively for years, which is why she left in the first place - they initially parted on good terms, but considering how much she emphasizes her creative freedom with her new label, it seems that these things have added up enough for her to care. She is still making money off the sales of both the new and old versions.",1995

t3_n5k4be,[Mass Effect/Our World (Our Timeline)] How well would a blue-water Human equivalent of the Quarian 'Migrant Fleet' work in our world? Would it be sustainable?,gx1uuvx,"As I see it, the critical problems that this fleet would face are: * Need of ports for dry-dock/repairs * fuel/power/non-food supplies and components * potentially population size/genetic diversity, estimates on minimum population range from 100 to 14000 people. Each of these problems has some potential solutions. Food would probably not be too big of an issue, actually. Gardens on decks + fishing + greenhouses/hydroponics could probably be fairly sustainable. Many modern ships have the power and machines needed to make/recycle their own freshwater, as long as they have power. Power and fuel are a problem. Solar and nuclear would probably be your best bet, but nuclear reactors are difficult to maintain and still need fuel occasionally. Traditional petroleum-based fuel would probably not be a good option, because reliable refueling would be unavailable. Sails might actually be their best option. Replacement parts would also be a major issue. You can do a lot with patch-jobs and homemade parts, but there is a limit. Major repairs will need a safe port, and possibly a dry-dock to fix serious problems. As for population, I think that it honestly would not be an issue, particularly if they are willing to pack people tightly. If the fleet manages to... ""aquire"", for example, 4 or 5 [Gerald R. Ford class nuclear aircraft carriers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_R._Ford-class_aircraft_carrier), they can each carry 3000-4000 people. Probably much more if you pack people in and don't have any aircraft. TLDR: if they have big enough ships, they can last a while, at least until they need fuel (nuclear or conventional) or need critical repairs/components they cannot make themselves. Or until somebody gets pissed at them for ""borrowing"" 5 *Gerald R. Ford-*class nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.",1820
t3_n5krrt,What desperate attempt has the company you worked for tried to keep you around?,gx1s26q,"When I was 19 I was working at a car dealership in the service department as a lot attendant (park cars, clean the service drive through area, bring cars out to customers when they come to pick them up, sometimes help move new vehicles, did some filing in spare time), I was supposed to be paid biweekly and they said my first pay would be after a month because of some filing issue. Well I didn't get my paycheck after the first month and I needed to pay bills so I talked to my manager about it and she just wrote me a check, not a paycheck with taxes and deductions taken off. I wasn't happy about it but I needed the money so I took it. 2 weeks go by and I'm supposed to be getting a paycheck again but there's still some sort of administrative issue so my manager told me she would have it to me by the end of the next week. Well surprise, surprise there was another issue, I told my manager I couldn't keep working there if I wasn't being paid properly, she offered me a position as a detailer (better pay and if I can do jobs faster I get more money, which is ideal for me because I am a fast worker) if I waited it out another week. So I said I would. The next week rolled around and I did get my paycheck, so I was happy about that, but when I went to ask my manager about the detailing job she said I would have to wait until another girl finished up her last 2 weeks. I agreed again, because I really wanted the detailing job, and the next week they hired another lot attendant ( I assumed to take over my position when I moved to detailing). But he was useless, he barely did any work so I had to run around doing his job too. I voiced my frustration to my manager and she said that I would be in detailing soon, so try not to worry. Well the 2 weeks passed quickly and I asked my manager again about the detailing position, when she decided to tell me they already hired someone to fill the spot, but I was so great as a lot attendant and I should really stay in that position.

t3_n68022,How can I make my own circle of friends and close-ones and not chase other people's dreams?,gx5n8oz,"First of all, it's amazing that you have realized that finding your own ideal social circle is a much better goal to have than aiming to become the center of the one you have randomly found yourself in. Here are a few steps you can follow to help you achieve that: 1. Stop chasing around meaningless friendships and trying to impress other people. Become absolutely certain that you are better off on your own than with a random group of people who don't care about you. 2. Start working on yourself more actively. Exercise regularly, read more than ever, chase your dream job or start a business. Explore various ways you can become the best version of yourself. 3. Slowly start meeting new people and see if you meet anyone who is a good fit for you as a friend. It's hard to know in the beginning since it takes time to get to know someone, but there is always a strong presence (or lack) of some chemistry from the start. If you are wondering how and where you can meet new people, here are a few ideas: * pick up interesting hobbies, preferably ones where you can socialize; * consider volunteering in a local community; * start going to the gym; * try out a recreation sports club; * join local clubs (book club, wine club, etc.); * explore online communities and see if you can meet interesting local people there. Also, there is an awesome blog out there which goal is to help you become the center of your social circle :)",1431

t3_n6embi,ELI5: Why does voltage not effect battery charge time?,gx6u55d,"The voltage is relevant because that is what determines the current. Let's look at Li-ion batteries. When they discharge an ion is moving from the cathode through the electrolyte to the anode. A li-ion is positive changes and an election will move from the cathode to the anode outside the battery so you do not get a net charge on either. There will be one election per lithium-ion. A current=charge/ time so the current is the number of electrons that move in the conductor. To recharge a battery you need to do the same in reverse and one election needs to move per lithium-ion. So to move back all lithium a fixed amount of charge need to go from the anode to the chatode. So the current= charge/time equation will be valid But let now look at what determines the current. A battery can be molded as a voltage source in series with the internal resistance of the battery. Not a perfect model but accurate enough for this post Ohms law applies so V=I\*R or I=V/R The voltage over the internal resistance is the difference in voltage you charge it with and the voltage of the battery if the circuit is open. So the current is ((Voltage over battery)-(battery open circuit voltage))/ (battery internal resistance). If you increase the voltage the current will increase. But all energy will not be used to change the battery, a lot of it will be heated from the internal resistance. When you change a lion battery you first change with a constant current and that is done by changing the voltage over the battery so you get the correct current. When it is at 80% you change to a constant voltage charging. You set the voltage to the final voltage you like to charge to. The current will now drop over time. Because battery internal voltage is not something you know exactly and it will change over time it simpler just to look at the current. &amp;#x200B; So charge time do depend on voltage because the current you have will depend on the voltage.",1948

t3_n810k1,Why is USB-C much faster than USB1 even though the connector is much smaller?,gxfxw9x,"The size of the connector has very little to do with the data transfer rate. Electrical signals travel through wires at the speed of light. It is how quickly the signals can be switched that determines the rate of data transfer. The original USB standard was described in the 1990s which is like the Iron Age as far as data communications for commercial purposes are concerned. It was designed to be cheap, reliable and ""fast enough"" for the uses at the time. Remember the internet wasn't even very developed at that time - real time video transmission was barely possible with the computers and networks of that era. Smartphones weren't even invented yet (at least nothing like a modern smartphone) 25 years later, electronics have become much cheaper, computers are faster, the internet is superfast. So the new standard is designed to fit the need of current applications. At the end of the day USB-C and USB 1.0 are simply standards ie a bunch of rules written on paper. These standards are always a compromise between cost and performance so that the manufacturers who adhere to them have something that is broadly useful yet not too expensive.",1149

I got about $40 worth more of tokens for him and told him I only could afford $10 more dollars worth of tokens and the nice lady heard it was his 11th birthday and we were the only ones there so she gave it to us for free.

You either have the ability and resolve to push through the bullshit or you don't, but you shouldn't expect the world to line up to help pull you over your personal finish line.

Also, seeing the countless of Twitter bots spamming about Dogecoin should be enough proof for everyone that it's a huge scam. And lastly, only 20 wallets own over 50% of Dogecoin. Those are the same people who pay these actors on social media to raise the hype. Elon Musk might be one of them, but I think Elon Musk is more likely riding the wave for PR.

t3_n98p8c,"People who have forgiven someone for something horrible, how?",gxmfwdv,"Through a lot of personal growth. Forgiveness is often hard because we don’t see the other person as being worthy of being forgiven. But we don’t realize that most of the time, it’s us who carries the burden of whatever happened, we carry weight, we carry negative emotions like hate and resentment, and those emotions and that weight interferes in our own personal well-being. To forgive is to lift the weight off of *yourself*, not the person you are forgiving. It will help that person recover and heal as well, or it may not affect them at all, but we can benefit from forgiveness either way. And who is to say who doesn’t deserve forgiveness. I believe there are more people who have done something wrong and truly hope to make up for it, learn from it, move on than there are people who can completely ignore the consequences of their actions. That being said, my forgiveness can help them recover and do better. It may even serve as a lesson for them to follow. I’ve even seen people treat me more kindly on the whole when they see how forgiving one can be. Hate and resentment are too strong of emotions to carry with you all of the time. Forgiving the “wrongdoers” helps keep you on a path of humanity and patience. Once you are able to forgive someone for something that seemed unforgivable, you will see many things in a new, more compassionate light.",1362

t3_n98q77,If Dormammu lives in a reality where time doesn't exist then how is he talking and communicating?,gxo1pr4,"What is time? From a standpoint of physics in our dimension, time can be defined as the direction of change in a system in which entropy increases. But that isn't true of the Dark Dimension. In the Dark Dimension, physics exist as Dormammu desires them to exist (within some limit, that limit being the potential of the various universes he has conquered). So time, as we understand it, does not exist in the Dark Dimension, however *change*, and even, if so desired, *linear change*, does, especially when you take into account that *our dimension was leaking into his and vice versa*. The portal opening was allowing our concept of time to leak in. The Infinity Stones only work in the universe they come from, if our universe's linear time hadn't leaked into the Dark Dimension the time stone would have been useless. Comprehending what non-directional entropy time looks like when the dimension is closed to us would be...difficult. Concepts like what you said, causality, the most basic, fundamental realities of our universe break down there. In the Dark Dimension, if Dormammu wants it, two plus two really does equal fish.",1130

t3_n9938v,"Eli5 What is glycogenesis, gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis?",gxmx8mp,"Glycogenesis: how your body creates glycogen. Glycogen is the animal equivalent of starch and is simply glucose molecules strung together. Your muscles keep a small supply on hand to do their job, and your liver is where your body keeps most of it. Gluconeogenesis: how your body makes glucose from smaller molecules when the supply of carbohydrates runs low. Some cells must have this because they can't run on ketones--like nerve cells. This normally doesn't happen since it's easier to convert other carbohydrates into glucose instead. Ketogenesis: how your body makes ketone bodies. This is how you get energy out of fats and amino acids. They're converted to ketone bodies that most of your cells can feed into the mitochondria to produce ATP. The ones that can't need the gluconeogenesis above.",800

I live in a left wing part of the US so guns are not very popular where I live so I would try to make a ranged weapon. This could be a knife attached to a pole or just anything sharp in general. The second thing I would do is get as much supplies as I could get. I have a few trees at my house and these could be kind of useful but I would not rely on them. I would scavenge around the house to see if I could find anything that can watch water (Buckets, Bottles that I can cut in half) These can be used to get water whenever it rains. This could help us dearly when the cities water supply is cut off. I would also start planting crops for food just in-case we have to stay here for a long time. I suggest also try to scout out the area and see if its safe. I would also try to contact my neighbors to see if they are friendly and if they are infected or not. This would help us form a bigger pack and could help us fight better against the zombies. I live fairly close to a supermarket and Walgreens so after some time I would head down there with some survivors and try to scavenge as much food and supplies as possible.

Shortly after I get there she texts me saying her Uber is taking for forever, which caught me off guard. Anyways she gets there and gets a drink. After she finished it she says “I’ll be right back” and a few minutes later she walks up to the bar with another dude around her shoulders. I took a pic of it and left.

Since you were going to invite four family members to the wedding, I suspect the relationships are not that far gone yet. What you should do, I think, is talk to each person and set very clear boundaries around what you are going to accept from them and what you are not. For example, to your older brother: ""I would like to have a better relationship with you. For that to happen, you must stop being rude to me, stop bringing up painful incidents from the past, and stop talking to me about older sister. You are entitled to have your own opinion about her and your own relationship with her. And I am entitled to have mine. I am not going to have contact with her, and when you tell me to do otherwise it causes me nothing but pain. So please do not bring any of these things up. And if you give older sister information about me against my will, I will not be able to have contact with you either."" To your mother: ""I appreciate that you want me to have a relationship with older brother. And I am now trying to do that by setting boundaries that I hope will allow us to be more civil with each other. However, it hurts me when you make excuses for his bad behaviors. He needs to take responsibility for those. So I have decided to stop bringing my complaints about him to you. I don't think that is doing any of us good. Instead, I've decided if he can't respect my boundaries, I'm just going to stop talking to him as I do with older sister until he sincerely apologizes and makes amends. You may think this is unfair or harsh, but I need you to respect my decision on this."" It is then up to you to point out to your older brother and mother when they have crossed your lines. You can say something like ""I asked you not to be rude to me. I am not going to talk to you when you act like this"" then hang up the phone or leave. You get to decide how many warnings they get before you cut them off completely. If they try to contact you, you can respond with ""I would like to talk to you, but first I expect an apology for \_\_\_\_\_."" Be consistently firm and they will change if they really want a relationship with you. P.S. Congratulations on your upcoming wedding, and your English is great.",2412

t3_nak85s,"Is Bourdieu’s theory of habitus deterministic? More specifically, is cultural capital determined by economic capital in a linear way, or can someone acquire cultural capital, even if less likely, beyond that which is associated with their class?",gxuh58o,"My sense is that, in Bourdieu's original conception, ""having an interest"" in high culture wouldn't be similar enough to ""participation"" in high culture. The argument being that a person who grows up appreciating fine art through images in books would not share the same degree of familiarity or breadth of knowledge as the person who regularly flies around the world to see it in museums and galleries. On the other hand, our enterprising bookworm would have more cultural traits in common with a globe-trotting art lover than with a globe-trotting horse enthusiast. I think within that framework it could be argued that individual *capacity* for developing a specific set of social markers is deterministic. For example, I could share a passion for baseball with the scion of a wealthy family, but my memorization of player stats would create a habitus that is fundamentally and irrevocably different than being able to fly around the country to watch games, meet players and owners, etc. I couldn't recreate that experiential base (hence Bourdieu's hypothesized links between the different capitals). On the other hand, our jet-setting sports fan might have trouble navigating the social niceties (such as they are) of a local dive sports bar. Our habitus would be determined in the sense that we are limited to our respective social circles and spheres of experience, but the direction of our development within our potential cultural capacity would be controlled and informed by our personal interests and exploration. If you haven't come across them already, you might be interested in reading * Lareau and Weininger (2003). *Cultural capital in educational research: A critical assessment*. Theory and Society, 32, 567-606. * Edgerton and Roberts (2014) *Cultural capital or habitus? Bourdieu and beyond in the explanation of enduring educational inequality*.

Despite being in neuroscience, no one (including me) knew that I should be resting and not doing things like taking freaking exams! I took a stats exam 2 days after my concussion and absolutely bombed it. I got a 50%. Lowest grade in the class. I was terrified I was going to fail the class, not cut out for grad school, etc. I cried and cried, and really did not handle it gracefully (but hey, I’d just gotten a concussion!). However, I eventually decided that I not only would recover from this slaying, I would master stats and get an outstanding grade on the next exam. Well... I did not get an outstanding grade, haha. BUT I worked my butt off with intense determination and performed MUCH better. Throughout all of this, the professors had 0 sympathy and offered 0 help even when I asked for it. So considering all that, I recovered from the bad grade and became better at stats because of it. All of this to say: take the L, and then use it to make yourself more determined and study harder next time. If you use an obstacle as an opportunity or motivation, then it was not a failure!

t3_nbcilr,"ELI5 How do people evaluate music, since everyone has a taste of their own?",gxykjs8,Music is an artform so there's no ultimate scale to evaluate music by. Even if you had to analyze the **noisiness** (i.e. the random up and down not the loudness) you'll still find extreme forms of rap and metal that can mathematically be defined as noise but for which there still are people who enjoy listening to it as well as analyzing **repetitiveness** you have your Trance enthusiasts. There are various objective measures that you can apply like using dynamic range analysis and your producers sitting in the recording studios have their ways of analyzing and improving music and vocals (see autotune). But really judging the end result is purely subjective. Today there is a big push for perfection with every note and every single instrument and this does pay off in the general audio quality of what you are listening to. But listening to older music has it's charm as there is character coming from each instrument and a genuineness from the vocals. It like comparing people with make up and without makeup.,1019

Same with how you see very few pontiacs left on the road these days, since Pontiac hasn't existed as a company for quite some time. You never see a Hudson anymore... etc. Also, civilian hummers were not very reliable. So once production stopped, they all fell into disrepair very quickly, which is part of why they went away so quickly.

WoW is pretty bad, because the game is seen as nerdy, but it is also considered a really boring grind and actively hated on by its own community. It also suffers from the stigma when it came out that people dropped out of college to play it. Star Wars is probably the least nerdy because it has really strong pop cultural connections, but it can get REALLY nerdy. Star Trek is up there, because it is not as hip as Star Wars and has a more philosophical focus than an action on. Magic is VERY nerdy. Probably tops the list of these. D&amp;D is probably the nerdy-est.

t3_nbs243,ELI5: What is the purpose of a video game disc?,gy11k7g,"You've nailed it - discs have no real advantage over digital copies aside from the ease to lend, sell, or transfer them and the niceness of having the box on the shelf. The only other really relevant perk is the ability to install a game without an internet connection - especially if you happen to live in an area with a poor or intermittent connection. But considering how many games need major day 1 patches to clean up bugs and such, an internet connection is still fairly handy for modern games.

If you connect two grids that are the same voltage and frequency, but 180 degrees out of phase, it's like short circuiting double the voltage, because the positive of one grid is aligning with the negative of the other. A 50hz and 60hz grid will go in and out of phase 10 times a second, if you connected them when they were in phase, the 60hz grid would try to speed up the 50hz grid, and the 50hz would try to slow down the 60hz grid.

For some time two extra classes were being held in the evening time, one of them being physics. We had a young physics teacher who acted very creepy towards me. He would keep staring at me during the lecture so much so that other girls noticed it too. He would ask me to answer even though I hadn't raised my hand. At times I found him staring at my chest even though I never wore anything remotely revealing. He would also try to find ways to stop me after class but we had another class after his, so he would never get the chance as after their classes, teachers had to mostly leave the institute. Once after both of our classes were over, me and my friends were walking on the driveway towards the main gate, when a car entered through the gate was was driving towards us. We got to the side, letting the car pass. As it was around 7 in the evening and also, winter time, we couldn't see who was driving. As we left the premises of the institute me and my friend were talking for some time near the main gate before going our different ways. Were just talking when my friend said, ""Don't turn now but derek (imaginary name) is staring at you from his car."" I was shit scared. I lived alone in a hostel and this creepy dude was in his car, staring at me, the same car, mind you that we had just passed. I didn't want to leave alone because what if he followed me and got to know where I live. Also, it was dark and my hostel was a bit far. Eventually he left in almost 10 mins. All this while he had done nothing but stare. As soon as he left, i ran back to my place. The next day, another one of my friend told me that she saw him pass us in his car, drive for a bit, and then make a huge U turn making a loud screech making all passerby look. I didn't go to his class anymore and changed my section. Still this incident gave me a mild trauma and I would look out for his car every time I left hostel.",1993

t3_nd2bsn,ELI5: forgive my ignorance but why aren’t all airplanes equipped with parachute or something to slow their decent if something fails?,gy885lk,"A parachute large enough to ""safely"" decelerate a plane would be extremely cumbersome to install, maintain, and carry. Many times when things go wrong with the plane, it can still glide. Catastrophic plane crashes are usually in situations where a parachute won't help either. If a plane loses engines a few seconds after takeoff, there's not enough altitude for the parachute to deploy before the plane hits the ground again. If the plane loses control when landing, it's the same problem. Instrumentation errors means that the pilots don't know they're flying into a mountain/the ocean, so they wouldn't think to deploy the parachutes anyway. A parachute is only really useful if the plane has a catastrophic, structural failure, like a wing falling off. These kinds of things are much less common than other failures, because the strength/structure of the wing is (relatively) simple matter, compared to the control and power systems of the plane and pilot training.",969

The light from the observers room is dim enough to be washed out by the reflections of the lit room thus all people see in the well lit room is there own reflections, meanwhile the light from the observed room greatly overpowers the reflection from the observers room, allowing for easy viewing. You can try this yourself if you have a window or a glass door near a light fixture. Wait until it's night, turn on the light and try to look out the window without leaning against it. Chances are you will see nothing but a reflection. Go outside and then look in. You'll be able to see everything in perfect detail.

t3_nd6pmc,ELI5:Is infinity of numbers from 0 to 1 as big as the infinity off all numbers?,gy8y7yc,"Yes. And no. It depends what you mean by ""as big as."" Infinity is infinite, so talking about its size is a bit complicated. A mathematician called Georg Cantor did a lot of work in this area, and came up with the idea of ""countable"" and ""uncountable"" infinities. A countable infinity is one which you can count. Sure, you'll never get to the end (because it is infinite), but you can keep listing them. The positive whole numbers are the basic example of countable infinity - you can start counting at 1 and after an infinite amount of time you'll have got all the numbers. An uncountable infinity is one that you can't count. You can't put them all in a numbered list; there are too many of them. ""Real"" numbers are uncountable. There are an uncountably infinite number of numbers between 1 and 2, if we're allowed to use real numbers. There is no way to list them. Set theory (which Cantor developed) has a whole series of symbols to represent the ""size"" (or ""cardinality"") of infinite sets, called [aleph numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_numbers). Aleph-nought or aleph-zero (א followed by a subscript 0, I can't figure out how to type that in my browser) represents the size of the set of positive whole numbers, and then there is an aleph-one, aleph-two and various other numbers. Except these don't work like normal numbers.",1342

t3_ndtpg3,How do you make your characters sound different from one another?,gycnfhv,"When I'm planning everything out, I think of a few people or characters that I'd like each of my own characters to resemble.

I can imagine how either of those characters would speak, so I ask myself what they would say in this situation, and how they would say it - clipped, direct, and seeing straight through everyone's bs. Eventually, I get a good feel for how my own characters would react, but these comparisons help me keep them in the personalities and speech patterns that I originally envisioned. If this is an area you really struggle with, it might be better to fix dialogue after you've finished the story, so you can focus solely on that. You could pull out everyone's lines and look at each character's path individually, to check consistency. I find that doing a shitty job on something and then fixing it is easier than trying to do it perfectly the first time.",1012
t3_ndw5kq,How do I learn self-control?,gyd5q5o,"Breaking through these habbits is tough.

It's hard to quit watching porn from one day on the other. So set little steps for yourself, reduce the amount of times you watch porn per week for example. And learning to control yourself is hard, very hard. If you get the urge to over-use something bad, realising that it's something bad is the first step. So when you realise that try to go and do something positive instead.

This is part of an entire series of similar books. While they aren't the most gripping reads, they are quite short. Each author writes differently, though they all attempt to write in plain english. Another option, which I also recommend, is Naomi Oreskes' ""Why Trust Science"" \[[on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Science-University-Center-Values/dp/0691212260/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=why+trust+science&amp;qid=1621258132&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1)\]. In the first half, Oreskes outlines a very brief history of the philosophy of science. In the latter half, she turns to outline a case for why the public should trust science, largely based on consensus. I find her work more sociological/historical than philosophical, but regardless, it can give an introduction to some of the main ideas. Its also well-written and enjoyable to read.",1055

There were other sales schemes, like having a percentage off sale, but people (rightly) didn't want to stand there figuring out how much was knocked off of each item.

t3_nehuzs,People who have gotten over irrational insecurities about dancing. Fucking how?,gygbygh,"I used to be like this. The key is to figure out what kind of judgement you'd like to avoid; the specifics help decide how to get over it. I couldn't dance in front of people and I realized it's because they knew me and could remember it -- so I tried dancing in the middle of a packed, somewhat dark room full of strangers where no one can see you (cause you're lost in the crowd, hiding in plain sight) and no one remembers because you're a stranger like everyone else. I did this a bunch of times and then I'd slowly add a few familiar faces in the crowd but not a lot. By that time I'd be used to dancing around people and it made it easy to forget there were some familiar folk. Gradually I got used to it all and got over it. However, if your trouble is people seeing you *at all* (which may partially be why you were more comfortable with your wife), then try getting your closest friends (or family) over, just a few to begin with, and try dancing. Keeping a dark room always helps for me because I just feel less conscious, but you can set it up the way you want. People who you don't have much to lose with because you're already pretty comfortable with them. If drinking or anything else helps you loosen up, have a bit, but not too much. You want to make it easier but you also want to experience and successfully overcome your difficulty in a replicable way. You can repeat this a bunch of times, gradually adding people or mixing up your environment to get used to it. Take it as slow as you'd like. The main thing to remember is that regardless of all this: even the best dancers don't always want to dance, so if at some point you feel insecure about dancing, you don't have to dance! Don't feel forced. You're supposed to do what you enjoy, and sometimes you may not be in the mood but that doesn't reflect poorly on you. And more importantly, you're not dancing for others -- you're dancing for you! This isn't a competition, and your personal goal isn't to be technically proficient. If the goal is to have a good time (which it is), then you just need to move the way you feel good. If you were trying serious dance moves but not feeling the music and just doing them mechanically, that'd be a shame. Just dance without thinking too much about how your body's moving, and remember that at the end of it all, at least you got a good time out of it. As a backup, in any case, it may be handy to just pick up some super easy movements (perhaps look up beginner dance moves on youtube) that you can revert to if you find yourself becoming conscious again, and then simply allow yourself to feel the music and transition back to moving naturally, however that may be. It gets easier, and it's *for* *you*. I know it's easier said than done -- but don't get in your head about this, just stay in your body. I'm sure you'll have a great time.",2855

Anyway, the reason why I've learned to enjoy this is that I usually have to take the highway to work, but on those staff meeting days, since I have to get up early anyway, I'll take the long way to work through local roads so I can just enjoy the drive and clear my mind and sometimes get breakfast while the meeting's going on. It's a small and mundane thing, but makes things just a little more bearable.",1017

She was so nice about it. When I told her everything that happened she started crying with me. She's now my little brother's science teacher, but she's been gone because she just had a baby girl.

t3_nf4kjn,How much harder are STEM majors compared to other majors?,gyjpoe0,"They're ""harder"" in the sense that they require more contact time than humanities and will require more practical skills like labwork. So in terms of time spent in lectures and time spent studying, it will be more work. But it's all a matter of skillset and fit. If you're interested in it, it isn't too hard. I've done BSc, MRes, and a PhD in a STEM setting (Neuroscience) and I reckon I found it easier than I would Geography or History for example, just because I'm far more interested in it. I never really know what to say when people are like ""oh you must be really smart"" or shit like that, cos to me, it's no different than being an expert in any other field. It's just got a reputation that I don't think is 100% deserved. If you're truly interested in one of them then pick a STEM subject, they do tend to lead to higher earnings. If you aren't really interested though, it *will* seem incredibly difficult. You need at least a little passion for the subject to motivate you to do the work or it will be a chore. Play to your strengths and interests. In the end, it would be better to get a 1st class degree in literature or art than it would be to get a 3rd in STEM.",1177
t3_nf98bo,"People who have taken or are taking AP US Gov exams, what are some tips to study or for the exam?",gym59g1,"For essays don't be scared to have opinions on things. It doesn't matter what the opinion is as long as you can back it up with some evidence and articulate it well. For the multiple choice a lot of the supreme court cases do come up and it's hard to say which ones. Also keep in mind the general stuff like time management. I forget the details but if you have 2 hours to answer 100 multiple choice questions, 1 hour in you should be at or past question 50 so keep a general eye on that ever 15 minutes or so so you can at least look at and attempt all of them. Don't spend a while thinking about something you have no idea about just guess and make a note to go back later if you can. If it helps I didn't find it the most challenging AP exam although that definitely varies by the person, but if you know your stuff and ideally if you have a general background in politics meaning you're politically aware, you should be in great shape. I remember getting to the essay portion and the first question was something super generic like what is a democracy vs a republic lol.

t3_nfiyaa,ELI5 how the krebs cycle works?,gymzx0y,"Whenever you eat food, the digestive system breaks down larger, complex molecules (polymers) into smaller, simpler molecules (monomers). There are three main categories of food polymers: fats, proteins, and carbs. Fats are broken down into fatty acids, proteins are broken down into amino acids, and carbs are broken down into simpler sugars like glucose. Any time you break chemical bonds, you release some energy. In this case, breaking chemical bonds in food releases energy in the form of high-energy electrons. The body wants to harness some of this energy by storing it as a high-energy chemical bond in ATP. Electrons flow from high energy to low energy, like a stream flowing downhill. In the same way that a waterwheel or water turbine can harness some of the energy of water flowing downhill, the enzyme ATP synthase can harness some of the energy of electrons flowing downhill (by transforming it into rotational kinetic energy). This process allows the conversion of ADP to ATP, providing the cell with energy. One way to make this process more efficient is to add many intermediate steps. Instead of water flowing down a hill, imagine water flowing down a staircase, with a small waterwheel at each step. This setup allows more energy to be harvested than if there were just one large waterwheel on a straight-line hill. The acids in the citric acid cycle are like the steps on this staircase. They minimize energy loss by breaking the flow of energy into many smaller steps. As another way to think about it, burning energy from food is a controlled combustion reaction. We can harness more energy by burning the fuel in many small, controlled, slow steps instead of just burning it all at once as a giant explosion. As a summary of the actual chemistry, the electrons released by breaking chemical bonds in food flow in this order: food polymer --&gt; food monomer --&gt; pyruvic acid (from carbs or protein) or fatty acid (from fat) --&gt; acetyl coenzyme A --&gt; citric acid cycle --&gt; NADH --&gt; electron transport chain --&gt; ATP. To expand this summary, electrons in the citric acid cycle flow like: citric acid --&gt; isocitric acid --&gt; alpha-ketoglutaric acid --&gt; succinyl-coenzyme A --&gt; succinic acid --&gt; fumaric acid --&gt; malic acid --&gt; oxaloacetic acid --&gt; citric acid. I doubt that you will need to know all of these steps unless you're really into biochemistry. The important thing is just that electrons are flowing downhill from food to ATP by passing through many chemical intermediates. This is a slow, controlled burning of energy. Some additional details: the bottom of the hill in this metaphor is an oxygen molecule. Electrons flow into part of an oxygen molecule, which then rapidly combines with hydrogen in the cell to form water. Also, some steps of the citric acid cycle form carbon dioxide, since the carbon atoms in food are rearranged when food molecules are broken down into simpler substances. This is why the chemical equation for cellular respiration is basically: food + oxygen --&gt; water + carbon dioxide + energy.",3090

He had his own bay in the garage to clean and fully detail cars for deliveries, the showroom, or prepared for the lot. If he had too many cars to do, we also had a partnership with a car wash about a half a mile down the street, so we could drop cars off to them, and they would call us when they were ready. Typically, cars getting put on the lot don't get detailed; maybe a rinse/exterior wash. Showroom cars and deliveries were the ones that got fully detailed and took the longest to do.",605

t3_ngmkc2,"ELI5: what is the difference between the various ""moving"" pitches in baseball, i.e. the slider, the cutter, the curveball, and the breaking ball?",gyrrdcs,"It’s the: movement, the break, and the speed. Let’s list them according to speed. A cutter traditionally is faster than a slider and a slider is traditionally faster than a curveball. So a hitter gets synced, used to, to the speed a pitcher is throwing the baseball. If the pitcher consistently throws the same speed, the hitter should have a better chance at hitting the ball in play. So the pitcher will vary the speed of their throws to “unsync” the hitter. Another thing the pitcher can do is throw different types of pitches to further “unsync” the hitter. This is where throwing a cutter, a slider, and a curveball come into practice. A curveball, does just that, it should curve as it is pitched from the pitcher to the hitter. This gives the hitter the impression that the ball is going to cross the batter’s box in the top left corner upon leaving the pitcher’s hand but it curves upon entering the box and enters the box outside the bottom right of the box, thus “unsyncing” the hitter. This dramatic shift from the pitcher’s release to where it lands in the box is known as the break. The overall change in direction is the movement of the ball. The slider does not break as much as the curve, and a curve can curve in many directions; where a slider is generally flatter but sometimes can be slightly vertical, but it can move just as much. The cutter generally does not break as much as the slider but like the other two it can move just much. Remember though, there are the varying speeds of the different types of pitches. So when all the different combinations of speed, movement, break, and pitch type are changed up it leaves the hitter guessing and that is why a hitter hitting 30% of the balls thrown at them is considered a great player!",1758

t3_njvegv,What's good as a hobby but terrible as a profession?,gzbbvmb,"Woodworking. I do it as a hobby, i just love it. But i can't imagine to do it as a profession. It is not that i would not want to do it, it is more that i don't want to have to do it, or else my family will starve. I like to stand in my workshop for hours on end, creating things with my hands. I've been told that my furniture would easily sell for thousands of dollaras, but i like to have the choice if i go into my workshop or not. If i do it for a living, i have to go into my shop, even if i don't want to. As a hobby, i want to go into my shop. Or not. Doesn't matter. If i want to spend my day on the couch instead of the workshop, doesn't hurt my wallet even a bit. If i do it as a job, every minute not spent in the shop is lost money. Money, my family and me would desperatly need. That way, woodworking would loose its appeal pretty fast....",853

t3_nl75cm,"ELI5: can someone please breakdown the differences/relationships between Linux, Unix, Bash, and Terminal (MacOS)?",gzh2xif,"Unix is an operating system that was first developed around 1970 by Bell Labs. The development branched to different projects including research unix. Research unix was further developed by UC Berkeley and released as Berkeley Software Distribution or better known as BSD. BSD had some licensing issues with copyrights that some people disagreed with so a group created a fully free version called FreeBSD. A company called NeXTSTEP took aspects of BSD and FreeBSD and put them together with a unix base to create their own operating system. Apple bought NeXTSTEP and took their operating system and rebranded it to become OSX which is now macOS. A software engineer named Linus Torvalds wanted to play with unix while at university but couldn't afford the licensing costs so he tried to create his own version and released it for free called Linus's unix: linux. It's not even close to the same as unix in architecture, but the people who jumped onto the project worked to make everything work well with unix programs. Today, many programs that work on linux can work well on unix and BSD with a few modifications. When these systems were first created, the only way you could use them was via a terminal prompt since there wasn't anything for graphics. Underneath the UI of the modern operating systems are system calls and you can interact with the system via the terminal when needed. The terminal in macOS is a terminal emulator that is a graphical copy of how the terminal works; almost everything you can do normally through the terminal you can do through an emulated terminal. Terminals use shells to interpret commands. The original shell for unix was bourne shell often just referred to as ""sh"". This was very limited over time and people wrote a more advanced shell based on bourne called ""bourne again shell"" or ""bash"". Bash is also a programming language you can use for writing scripts. It's a way to natively interact with the computer via the terminal and how the shell interprets the commands. What you are doing when working in your terminal is working with you computer without fancy graphics and windows. Everything you can do in windows that interacts with the system directly can be done through the terminal.",2232

It's on Steam, Epic, GOG, Playstation, and Xbox. Be sure to get System Redux instead of the regular version. It's an enhanced version. It's also on Switch, but that version has to deal with the Switch's hardware limitations. If you like Lovecraft, check out Conarium. It's on Steam, Epic, GOG, Playstation, Xbox, and Switch. There's also The Medium. I'm playing through it currently. It's a bit more of a walking simulator than a survival horror game, but it does have stealth sections and is very atmospheric.

t3_nl7m1o,Is what is considered beautiful socially constructed for the most part ? In that case is physical attraction itself a social construct rather than some objective attraction ?,gzhhebs,"I think there is a misunderstanding about what social construction means. Being socially constructed doesn’t mean it is artificially constructed or not real. In Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann’s 1966 seminal book [The Social Construction of Reality](https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/The_Social_Construction_of_Reality.html?id=BEEh1Stk5NIC&amp;redir_esc=y), social constructions posit two assumptions regarding knowledge. First, that it is social, meaning that it is intimately tied to the current social norm, culture, mores, ideologies, etc. Second, that it is constructed, meaning that it doesn’t need to be that way. One can always imagine it looking differently (or constructed in a different way). Case in point, our perception of beauty or fashion changes over time. Of course, what one consider beautiful depends a lot on the way evolution has worked. But, there are things that we value that doesn’t quite make sense from a evolutionary perspectives, such as choices of clothing, hairstyles, tattoos, jewelry, which are all human inventions and institutions and, therefore, socially constructed, precisely because they don’t exist objectively in nature, but inter-subjectively (meaning agreed upon by everyone) in society.",1237

t3_nl7m17,ELI5: how does human sight at great distances work?,gzh7vpo,"Distance in itself has no effect on if you can see something. If enough light from the object reached your eye you can see it. The brightness of a light source will drop with distance because the same amount of light bread out over a larger area. The result is if there is nothing in between you and a light source there will be some distance where it is to dim to see. So you could not see Jupiter at 1 light year because it will be too dim. You could use our sun because it emits an enormous amount more light than Jupiter reflects. A quice calculation results in 467 million times more emitted light from the sun the Jupiter reflects. This is ignoring that from a long distance away Jupiter will be close to the sun in your field of view so even if you could see it if it was alone you could see it beside the brighter sun. How far you can see on earth have to do with the curvature of the earth and how the atmosphere bends light. The scattering of light can also have an effect. So it is not exactly comparable to how you see stuff far away in the sky. consider if you are in a circular house and put your head out of the window. You would not see a lot of it because it curves away but if you went outside a bit away from the house you could see a lot more of it. You can see a lot further on earth than 3 miles. That is the distance to the horizon if your eyes are 6 feet above the surface for a level area like calm water. The horizon is where stuff starts to be hidden if you looked at your friend that also is as tall as you on a boat 3 miles away the toe starts to be hidden if the feet touch the water. The eyes of your friend will be hidden at twice the distance so 6 miles away. Something tall like a building 60 feet tall starts to be completely hidden a bit over 10 miles away. The distance to the horizon depends on your elevation and if you are on the roof of a building with the eyes at 60 feet the horizon is 10 miles away. Use https://www.metabunk.org/curve/ to calculate the distance to the horizon had what is hidden behind it So you can see a lot more of earth from ISS because it is high up but it is still only 3% of the surface that is visible. The higher up has another advantage and that is air scatter light. Mountain look like they are in a haze because the air in between will scatter light. The amount of air between you and space is equivalent to 8.50 km, 5.2 miles at sea level. So if you look at a mountain 16km away the light passes to twice the amount of air as if you look at it from ISS. There is also more dust close to the ground so looking at ground level will be even worse. So how far you can see in space and one Earth depends on different things. On earth is tuff that is in the way that block or scatter light. In space, the object gets dimmer because of the distance.",2816

Another strategy, as I was writing an essay (specifically on Heidegger), I read other academic papers engaging with the texts and interpretation of the themes covered.

They may seem intimidating at first, but as long as you handle them in a professional manner, you’re golden no matter the outcome. • If you feel like that job doesn’t suit you, please don’t stick around because they pay a certain amount or that you’re obligated to for some reason. It’s okay to find something you do have at least a little joy doing. • Kindness is key; even if you have a crappy coworker, a bad day, or a Karen customer, kindness comes in handy. Instead of scowling at the lady demanding a markdown on an item that doesn’t need it, smile and tell her to please wait while you get your manager. • This all being said, however, please also remember at times to stick up for yourself or be honest. If you are being accused of something you didn’t do, tell them that. If a coworker is being a dick, tell someone. You can be nice and also take care of yourself in those instances. I work at a retail store, so not all of these may fit 100%; I tried to be as general as possible. Bottom line: Be nice/polite, stick up for yourself if necessary, and be prepared (sadly not everyone is very nice and have a stick up their ass).",1281

t3_nme61p,Is the Categorical Imperative a method of morality?,gzsj22i,"Well Kant's answer would be that whether an act is universalizable is the question of whether it is a morally good action. And his reason for why this is the case is that for a person's reason for action to be permissible it must be a reason which all people could act on. And this matters because of the way Kant understands human beings as autonomous creatures, which can be good only if motivated by a good will. So if you take the CI by itself it might seem that it is not a test for moral goodness, badness, permissibility, etc, but Kant has reasons why the CI is a test about morality which he argues for in the Groundwork and elsewhere. You could also look at how these positions connect in the SEP article on Kant's Moral Philosophy, which does a good job breaking down the separate positions Kant takes on moral issues and how he combines them in his project. (Edit: Just want to note that this objection could basically be leveled at any moral theory, which might help you see where the question is off. Example: Utilitarian calculus only tells us how much pleasure/suffering an act creates, not if it is good. But the Utilitarian point in using that calculus is because pleasure is good, for which they offer arguments.)",1231

What features does it have which makes it a majestic piece of engineering?,gzt8zf5,"Your opinions are shared with most of Paris and half of the rest of the world. It was designed in the early 80s when this type of architecture was quite new and modern, which did not last long. It is sort of minimalistic which is a great contrast to the surrounding buildings but its design is still more driven by aesthetics rather then functional design which was in contrast with brutalism which was the most popular minimalistic architectural movement of the time. It does provide a lot of light and open air to the lobby underneath it which is inspired by Roman villas. So you can say a lot of bad things about the pyramid. And some good things if you take the time at which it was designed into account. But at least it does make people talk about the Louvre and have become a very iconic landmark in Paris.",813

Even if you barely sleep at night or don’t sleep at all, force yourself to get out of bed at 7AM. Do NOT take any afternoon naps or cheat. It is exhausting. After 2-3 weeks, your body will readjust automatically to those times, and will start maximizing the total time it sleeps during those 7 hours. Edit: it also helps to have a fixed eating schedule as well. Have dinner at 7PM for example everyday.

The cashier then said they he has extra masks and they are for 5rs each (extremely cheap, rs is indian currency, 1$=70rs) and those dudes said ""we don't have money, give to us on loan"" mocking the worker. The cashier said that they will have to leave the store since it's company policy and it says so on the outside of the shop. Those dudes said ""man you didn't put the notice on the door and I didn't see it, so I'm not gonna leave.

t3_nnngh1,"Is there a limit on what you’re allowed to research, or can you do what you want as long as it gets funded?",gzw0ezn,"There are limits. They will depend on the institution you work at. Generally speaking, it is the university that accepts research grants, not you as an individual, and the university can decide not to accept the money you applied for if they don’t want to support that kind of work or don’t have the infrastructure to handle it. There are going to be a lot of regulatory issues, physical space issues, security issues, etc. around those kinds of work, and a university that has already solved those issues for other people doing similar work will have a much easier time agreeing to accept another grant. A university that doesn’t already do, say, cryogenics work is less likely to be willing to set up all the necessary facilities and processes just for you. This can change depending on where you are in your career. A well established and prestigious researcher can have a lot of leverage to negotiate when changing universities. A new researcher is unlikely to find a university willing to bend over backwards to suddenly develop an explosives handling program if they don’t have one already.",1096
t3_nnmw6e,"ELI5: If you go to bed hungry, why do you wake up not as hungry?",gzvjlkt,"You know how we eat to provide fuel for our bodies? Well the process of food getting turned into fuel and used by our bodies is called our ""metabolism."" When you are sleeping, because you're not eating, that process slows down, like how a fire goes out when you stop adding wood to it. (But it's not like when you're awake and don't eat for a long time and feel really hungry, because you're unconscious, so you don't ""feel"" the hunger while your metabolism is slowing way down.) When you first wake up, your metabolism hasn't jumped back into action yet, and so your body doesn't tell you to eat right away. Funnily enough, EATING is what will kick your metabolism back into gear. Also, little messengers called ""hormones"" get sent around your body when it's time to wake up so that you will have enough energy to get up, but they also cause the amount of sugar in your blood to go up. That can make you feel a little bit queasy too. Also also, your stomach can make acid when it thinks you're going to eat soon, but if there's nothing in there for it to work on, it can make you feel queasy too.

t3_noe1iw,What is the teaching to science ratio for a researching academic at a research Institute?,h01gdb3,"I'll second Suspicious\_mAb- it depends. Really you divide up into three things: teaching, mentoring, and research (+ service and administration, but let's ignore those). Mentoring is the one that really is ambiguous here. I've been a professor for 12 years at an R1 in STEM. I'm on a 1/1 (one course per semester), though 2/1 is more normal for our department. Since I've taught everything a few times before, this usually is a one-day-per-week commitment between lecturing and grading. That gives me roughly 4 other days in the work week to do non-teaching. I do sometimes spend more days per week than that, but I have the luxury of being tenured and taking things easy now. Most free time (4 days/week) is spent on mentoring and writing. Mentoring is a good split of both- it's teaching, and research. Given my time outside of mentoring is mostly writing, this mentoring is the route by which we produce research. I get into the lab somewhat infrequently, but more often on some occasions (summer, for instance, is ongoing now, and so I will go in to set an experiment up or use the equipment a few times). I'll meet with my grad students/postdocs usually 1 or 2 times a week. I help address problems, decide what to do next, and help interpret data. I also check in on their writing progress. Where I'm at right now, most of my time is more valuably spent in writing, usually proposals and papers. These fund the lab directly and indirectly. Writing is still research and uses brain power, but it's not the joy of setting up a successful experiment or getting a key set of data. Being involved in day-to-day lab work doesn't create as large an impact as a PI.",1664

After evading his offer of taking me to some shady coffee shop, I told him I wanted to go to the local bookstore which he agreed to. He gave me a ride with his motorcycle (a VERY common vehicle where I'm from). All throughout the trip, I had google maps open on my phone in one hand, and in the other was a cutter I brought with me in a pocket. To my surprise, he did bring me to the bookstore. Come 10 pm, the bookstore closes and I told him I just wanna go back. Again with the google maps and cutter combo. But this time, all the way back to my flat he blabbered about offering me to sleep at his place (which is 30mins from the bookstore, my flat was 5 mins from the bookstore). I kept declining, he kept insisting, saying things about taking me to see the sunrise in the nearby tourist spot. I got so fidgety with my cutter it might poke him a bit through my hoodie pocket. He asked, ""What was that?"" I just stayed quiet until he dropped me off at my flat. I don't know what got onto me (maybe the adrenaline from the whole thing) but I managed to gather the courage to wave goodbye at him with my hand still holding the cutter. He went away so fast and still has the balls to text me, ""You're a woman, why are you carrying stuff like that?"" I blocked him and deleted the chat. That was almost 2 years ago.",1602

Once you figure out which size moving can you’re getting, note the interior dimensions and block off those dimensions in your current home to start queuing up what to take. Anything that doesn’t fit in that space isn’t going with you. Boxes are free at the liquor store but don’t underestimate the value of real moving boxes of uniform shape/size. You can get them from Lowe’s or on Craigslist from person who have just moved to your area. If you can line up a rental ahead of the move, landing in the new town is easier. Go to the forum at city-data.com to research neighborhoods before you commit to a rental. Check cell phone coverage for your provider for your route.

t3_n32914,ELI5 Why does genital size on humans vary so much from person to person but the rest of our organs are relatively the same size?,gwn3f72,"You're not talking about all genitals, you're just talking about one organ in particular. Nobody compares uterus size, prostate size or ovary size, only one organ is measured by size. That organ you're asking about is our good friend and our true master, known as the penis. The little general. And the answer will both shock and fail to impress you. The answer is because they don't vary in size very much at all, and because size literally doesn't matter to the females of our species. Lemmy explain why... A guy's size can only be truly measured when that thing is standing at attention. In default resting mode, it can look like anything from a limp eel to a little pimple, but erect most of them are roughly the same size. There are a few notable exceptions like Jay-Z or Tommy Lee, but those are the exceptions and not the rule. I'm considered a small guy at 5.5 inches, but a guy with just over 6 inches is considered gifted by the gods. That's not much of a difference at all, especially when you consider where it's designed to go. The female counterpart organ, also known as the vagina (or the Great Divide, the Happy Valley or the baby cannon), is an organ that even modern science can't fully explain. It's made of highly elastic tissue, elastic enough to fit an entire baby through the opening, yet when it's in default resting position it's only 4 inches deep (for a big one) and the inside walls are all touching each other. Even if after girl gives birth to her 10th baby, her VJ will quickly return to its natural size and shape. While the external appearance of the vulva may be altered by childbirth, the size and function of everything will not. Think about that... 3 to 4 inches deep, inside walls touching each other, and the rest is all elasticity. If you put your smallest finger into there, you can touch the sides in every direction and almost reach the bottom. But given enough time and effort, that thing can stretch out enough to fit a whole baby through it. No guy, not even those freaks of nature, can come even close to the size of a baby. Penis size does matter, but it turns out it only matters in the locker room.",2148

I loved reading, and sometimes would sit down and read a whole novel in 2-3 sittings while the rest of the class was being assigned 1-2 chapters at a time. But I couldn't NOT do it if the book was good - for example I liked Charles Dickens and would charge through any of his books. Often they were mad because doing this would break their assignments. They might want us to use our imagination to predict what will happen next, or identify possible examples of foreshadowing before they came to pass. It was also a problem in class discussion when I would bring up things that hadn't happened yet. My favorite English teacher just modified my assignments instead of getting mad. Gave me different writing prompts as needed. And to keep class discussions on track he asked me to go back and skim the assigned chapters just before class so I knew where other people were. I happily complied. Seemed a lot better than telling a child NOT to read more.",1037

My heart was racing because I really liked her, and hoped she felt the same way. When we made eye contact, she broke into this huge smile and my heart stopped racing because I knew she liked me, too.

The rotomphone was similarly designed to interface with a rotom, and these features were not included. My guess as to why a designer would want a talking Pokédex but not a talking phone is that way the Pokédex could act as a guide and offer information with greater ease. We see in the anime that the original Pokédex talks to the trainer to offer advice and information, and the Rotomdex goes a step further by replacing the AI with a rotom. This seems less important with a cellphone, so it wasn’t included. As for the flying, would a flying cellphone really offer more as a product?

After the reveal, you have a 50/50 chance of picking the correct door (in a closed system), but because the original set had so many doors, you can be reasonably sure that you didn't randomly pick the only correct door, so the chance that the other door has the car is 999,999 in 1,000,000. If the car could be moved, it would become a 50/50 after the reveal, just like you said. Well, not quite 50/50, but you'd have to know the tendency of the host to move the car in previous games.

t3_n4dkof,What Was the Most Awkward Moments of Your Life?,gwv0sn3,"Having 600 people applaud my (presumed) loss of virginity. High school graduation, my date was graduating with me. We stupidly assumed that we didn't need to be in the line waiting to enter the auditorium with all other classmates 45 mins early, so we hung out at his house. Meanwhile in the alphabetical line of graduates standing outside the auditorium doors, two of my friends notice my absence and start talking to each other. My friend with last name ""A"" is talking to my other friend with last name ""G"", so several people in the line heard that I was missing. People who noticed I was missing included my date's friends ""K"" and ""J"", who were asking down the line about where my date was. And, before you know it, the entire class of 70 was noticing our absence. Now, since we arrived late and there was nowhere to park, we used a side door that was quite far away from our class. So we had a long walk of shame indoors when we finally arrived. Our entire class started applauding, wolf-whistling and cheering what they assumed we had done. All the noise traveled into the auditorium and the back of the room assumed the noise was due to the fact that the grads were entering the room, so they stood up and started cheering and clapping. The middle of the room thought that the people at the back were applauding because the grads were coming in, so they followed suit. And then so did the front of the auditorium. This means that, at one point, approximately 600 people were applauding the sex that I most definitely did not have. And I could hear the whole lot of them applauding long after I got in to my proper place in line. My dress was dark green and, combined with my face, I must have looked like Christmas in June. A year later at my brother's grad, people were commenting on the early applause from the year before, still confused that ""We all started clapping when the grads came in last year, but then it was another 10 minutes before the grads came in! What was that about?"" It has been 24 years. I am still embarrassed.",2039
t3_n4dhwm,How do you help New Writers?,gwuz6bj,"There are always people who are just starting writing.

Helping really depends on what their goals are/what their strengths are. If it's a hobbyist who just likes playing with some story they thought of, helping is just saying ""cool"" and maybe listening to them talk about it. If it's someone hiring me to help them become a better writer, then there's a lot more teaching that can be done (I mean... there are years worth of lessons just to get the basics covered). Differs from person to person. Some need confidence. Some need discipline. Some need a reality check. I'd say one of the biggest things to get across has always been that writing is a skill. Just because you can think of a great story doesn't mean you can write a great story, but that's fine. You wouldn't pick up a paintbrush for the first time and expect to paint a Rembrandt.

t3_n5862u,Why is revenge shunned upon mostly as to individual upon the individual?,gx077nf,"The short answer for why revenge is wrong is that acting out revenge makes things worse and not better. In the social sphere, one of the foundational justifications for having institutions of law is to prevent individuals from pursuing revenge themselves. There are dozens of reasons we don't want social order to depend on the enactment of revenge, but one of the most important is that settling scores through revenge doesn't tend to end matters, and one reason for that is because there is no settled way to know when the score has been settled. In particular, different parties are likely to disagree about whether a particular act of revenge was sufficient to settle the score, or excessive and itself requiring revenge, or deficient and needing to be shored up with more revenge. So, if A wrongs B, B visits revenge on A to B's, satisfaction, it may be that A thinks that A owes B revenge for that in turn even if B thinks things are now settled, starting the cycle anew. So, it's not just a general worry that cycles of revenge are likely to continue, we know the mechanism by which they are likely to continue, and that mechanism is a disagreement about what counts as the right amount of revenge. You are likely not to be surprised to hear that many early justice systems consist of standards about what is the appropriate amount of revenge for a wrong: the *lex talionis* we find in Babylonian, Biblical, and Roman systems, or the *weregild* system in Germanic societies. But once you're in for a penny, you're in for a pound: these standardised systems work best when they are interpeted and executed in standardised ways (to stop people feeling like the manner in which a standardised punishment was carried out is itself worthy of revenge), and once you have those, you have what is recognisably an institutin of justice much like our own in the important respects.",1878

I know it's a classic excuse for anyone who gets caught talking in class ""But miss, we were talking about THE WORK!"", but in this particular case I genuinely was. When the class ended and lunch time rolled around, the teacher suddenly remembered she couldn't stay with us for our detention because she had a meeting. So she sent me (and the guy I was sitting next to) to another building where we'd serve our detention by watching some kind of debating competition which was happening over lunch break, and she told us she'd come dismiss us at the second half of lunch, which should have been 20 minutes in. So we're sitting there watching this debate and the half lunch time bell goes. No sign of our teacher. Another 5 minutes pass. 10. 15. We're now 5 minutes from the end of lunch, she still hasn't showed up and we still haven't eaten, all because I dared talk to the guy sitting next to me about our lesson's worksheet. Finally, with 5 minutes of lunch to spare, the English head teacher (who was running this debating comp) stood up and said ""Anyone who is here for a detention may now leave"". Apparently we weren't the only ones - a bunch of students from other classes got up and left. So we breathed a sign of relief, walked out and tried to relish the remaining 5 minutes of lunch we had left. So we're sitting outside trying to shove down our lunch as quickly as possible before the bell goes, and what do we see? Our teacher walking up to collect us, with only 2 minutes of lunch to spare. We both looked at each other like ""you've got to be kidding"". The kicker? When she got there and found that we weren't still watching the debate, she decided (despite my attempts to explain what happened later) that we must never have gone at all, so she escalated our punishment to an after school detention. Did I go? Hellll no. My mum actually wrote a letter to her explaining what happened, but she was having none of it. She tried to claim that she spoke to the head teacher and that he had actually dismissed those who *weren't* on detention... but how does that even make sense? Why would those who were there voluntarily, and could leave at any time, even need to be dismissed in the first place? Thankfully she forgot about it and I never ended up going to her ridiculous after school detention.",2453
t3_n69ncs,What is one thing that you can never do right on the first try?,gx5t1es,"Okay this is kinda interesting actually. So I have a problem with lids. If I open two things with lids, for example let’s say a jar of peanut butter and a gallon of milk, I almost ALWAYS try to put the wrong lid on the wrong container first. I don’t know why, and it doesn’t matter that they are drastically different sizes and materials. If I’m not actively paying close attention to it, that peanut butter lid is gonna go to that gallon of milk like a moth to a lamp. I’ve had this problem for years, it drives me crazy sometimes. On a side note, I’m an oil painter, and if I’m doing a painting with a handful of circles, my eyes get very confused and it’s hard to track which one I’m looking at sometimes.

t3_n6vlyl,ELI5: How does furniture polish work?,gx9rhmq,"Wood is naturally porous - like a sponge. Wood is sometimes treated with oil, but typically it's vanished. Wood is basically coated in something to make it shiny. This coating can be too many things: * The excretions of lac beetles is very traditional (shellac, lacquer) - this is also used on many candies to make it shiny. * Nitrocellulose was popular in the early 1900s * Urethane or acrylic plastic is common today * Linseed oil is sometimes used * Natural waxes like beeswax, or synthetic wax from crude oil can also be used * Natural resins like amber, copal, and mastic can be used * Epoxy resins are used for extra durability The actual polish typically contains an oil or wax - when you rub this on it leaves a residue that makes it shiny. Some polishes can contain acids (vinegar, lemon, or synthetic ones), or solvents that can dissolve or thin some of the original finishes. Sometimes this can make it shinier, remove scratches, etc - but it can also weaken and degrade the finish. I would typically recommend a wax - like a paste finishing wax. These don't remove or damage the old finish, you're just adding something on top to make it shiny. If it's in bad shape - gel paint stripper to remove the old finish and a can or spray bottle of polyurethane will give it a good maintenance free finish that will last for many years.",1340
t3_n6z0qx,How would you go about deep cleaning an extremely messy house by yourself? How do you prevent getting burn out? What cleaning tips do you have?,gx9y20d,"The best cleaning tip i ever learned is this. Whenever you move from a room to another, do one task. Be it an empty glass, a piece of thrash, dirty clothes, clean clothes just laying there, washing the stove, counters name it. Doing so is so easy, just a few seconds of your time, but it helps keeping things clean all year round. As for cleaning a extremely messy house, i can only speak about a room, but in my teenagers i was a depressive mess. Overate and kept trash in my room. It got so bad, i had empty potato chips ,candy bars bag , soda bottles, cans, dirty clothes all around the floor. Once, it got to the point where the only"" clean"" space was enough room for me curled up on the bed. My parents cleaned that oned and i cried quietly in my room for a while , they never spoke a word of it,but i knew it was just love. I got this messy a couple other times, and well cleaning up involves kicking your ass up. Put some music you like . Then just make a list, have it like this. 1- Pick up trash ( this is where you get one or multiple trash bag and just dump everything that you wont keep in it. 2. - Pick up items that you will keep. Clean them, and move them out of the room you are in. 3. - Dust off walls/ furniture 4. - Sweep/vacuum 5.- Wash the walls/furniture/ floor 6- Put items you keep back at their place im the room. And do that one room at a time, you'll get a clean house eventually if you keep using the first tip i gave here. Now make that list for every room, and use it as a tool to help you progress. I know it seems stupid,but checking each boxes on each step when you're done is very rewarding. And to avoid burning out, but still get it done, make sure that everytime you have some free time, begin by doing one single task on the list. Any of those task doesnt take more than 45 minutes, and see after that if you feel like doing one more or then use your free time for hobbies or to relax! Now if you're asking on how to clean like what products to use or techniques, google is a very good professor , better than the advices i could give you.",2077

Their scales are similar to a chameleons skin in that they can adapt to their surrounding environment except that their scales augment their surface texture in addition to colour to blend in with wherever it is they find themselves. At night they will find a high branch to rest on and their scales will allow them to blend in so that arial predators wouldn't notice even if they were to accidentally land on them, and the trees foliage and their height from the ground protect them from anything that can't climb. Their faces are akin to a foxes with a long snout and their teeth are short but very sharp and fine to help them clip away their preferred meals quickly to minimise exposure.",1099

This became even more prevalent with the leggings fashion that blew up in the last 2-3 decades. Leggings are very form fitting and will show the panties very obviously. So if you wear full size panties, it will show the panties crease and outline on the butt. Women don't like that. But if you were a thong, it doesn't show that, you just see a smooth butt contour. Beyond that, thongs are just hot. They cover very little, show off pretty much as much as possible. Women like to wear hot fashion.

I hate that stuff more than anything, and it's a pity that it is by and large the 'face' of anime. Not all anime is like this, and I do agree that the fans of that kind of anime have pedophilic tendencies. Just because a lot of anime is written and animated to sexualize children does not mean all of it does 2) Anime is just a medium to tell a story - many animes have higher-quality adult animation than the above mentioned genre and tell an absolutely fantastic and well-written story. The good stuff has quality voice acting, incredible music, and beautiful animation. Overall, the appeal of anime is that it is a large industry that produces a vast variety of content. Much of that content is amazing and it's a pity to discard it simply because you are oversimplifying all of it 3) If you hate subtitles, many shows have very high-quality english dubs.

t3_n83l3w,"ELI5 How does the Monte Carlo method work, and apart from Pi, what can it be used to approximate?",gxgfetj,"So I am actually running a monte carlo simulation for a research project right now, here is the reason I would argue its the right tool for certain jobs. (hopefully in layman's terms) In research, we like to have testable hypothesis, so that we can give some estimate of whether our results are simply due to random chance, or whether we truly have a real result. The simplest way to do this is by running a linear regression. Without getting into what that actually entails, it is sinple enough to say that linear regression relies on a few assumptions. One of those assumptions is that we know what the distribution of our outcome is. For example, we know that a truely random coin should have a 50% chance of heads and a 50% chance of tails. Because we know this information, we can exactly determine how likely it was that we saw ""H H H H"" on 4 flips. We can then use that information to make the statement, The chance of getting 4 Hs in a row was ~6.25%. However, when we do not exactly know the distribution, we have to make assumptions about it, and those assumptions can have large impacts on our estimates of how likely an event was. For example, what if we though the chance to get a heads on a fair coin was 60%? Then we would assume that we would get 4 Hs in a row almost 13% of the time, which as you can see greatly changes our estimate of how likely the event we observed was How does a monte carlo simulation help? By using a monte carlo, we dont make any assumptions about the distribution, instead we let the data tell us what the distribution is and make our inferences on the liklihood based on the simulation.",1630
t3_n86ht5,eli5 How are natural resources like minerals and ores scattered around the place?,gxgxegu,"Minerals are the building blocks of rocks, which may be made up of a single or many minerals. Minerals can be simple and made of a single ingredient, like how diamonds are made of only carbon, or many ingredients, like clays and micas. So there are many minerals, and while most are common and not worth much, some are valuable because they are either useful to make machines or computer parts or jewelry, and they are hard to find and hard to extract. The rock that contains the valuable minerals is called ore. Iron ore contains minerals that are made up of mostly iron, enough to make a profit after you dig it up and separate the iron from the rest of the stuff. So that’s minerals and ore. They are found in deposits, and these deposits can take many forms. Here are a few: Placer Deposits: this refers to ore found in fluvial (river) sand and gravel deposits that has been weathered from a rock upstream and deposited downstream. They can be found as components of sedimentary rocks that have already lithified, or in active streams. If you’ve ever planned for gold, you’ve been hoping for a Placer deposit. Hydrothermal ore-forming processes: hydro=water, thermal=hot. The water in the ocean as well as the water contained in the cracks and pores of rocks deep beneath the earth’s surface are full of dissolved minerals. When hot water full of dissolved minerals is rapidly cooled and depressurized, as it does in volcanic and geothermally active locations, it interacts with the rocks and can leave deposits of minerals behind, as well as change the chemistry of existing rocks. The La Escondida copper deposit in Chile is one of the largest in the world and is the result of hot water, magma, and rocks interacting deep below the surface over tens of millions of years. You might see that a placer deposit may well originate from a hydrothermal deposit, and the gold that you can find with a pan in the foothills is the same gold that you need dynamite to get to up at the source. In geology we talk a lot about the rock cycle, how minerals are sort of along for the ride as they form different rocks and are cycled through the earth. Ore is a rock and takes the same path. Some deposits are locked up deep in a mountain or below the surface. Some are mixed up with the sand and gravel in a river bed. Source: I like rocks",2331

Please understand that when children mess up it's because they dont know any better and they really need you to teach them how to react.

t3_n876ba,ELI5: Why can’t people just code in more digital money whenever they want to?,gxgvp4i,"Bitcoin and those styles of decentralized currency don't have a central database to hack. Every transaction/mining operation is verified by the entire network (everyone who is mining), so you'd need a majority of those people to be in on the scam in order to pull it off. If you report a different transaction than everyone else, your transaction gets discarded as ""incorrect"". Centralized systems like banks use double-entry bookkeeping. That means that, for every addition to an account, there must either be a subtraction from another account (transferring funds) or a physical input (cashing a check or depositing cash). So the system admin would have to either fake transactions from real accounts (in which the owners would quickly find out) or try to fake a physical interaction (counterfeit money or a fraudulent check) in order to gain money for themselves. It should be self-evident that, if you're making counterfeit money that can pass bank inspections, you're in a far different tier than hacking bank accounts. And the banks' digital security is generally very good. Most fraud cases are from the physical or human elements (stealing cards, tricking people into handing over bank information, etc.) rather than hacking the system.",1244

t3_n94s6q,How did Kant determine on which level to classify an act?,gxmmkvk,"&gt; As I understand it, Kant determined that lying was wrong because if everyone did it, we would hate that. No, this is not true. Insofar as we might say that Kant anywhere defends the view that lying is always wrong, he would be presumably doing so using one of the forms of the categorical imperative. Those being, roughly: 1. Such an act would fall under a maxim which cannot be willed to be a universal law. 2. Such an act treats a person as a mere means. 3. Such an act is inconsistent with considering each rational will as a universally legislating will. 4. Such an act would fall under a maxim which is inconsistent with being a universally legislating member of a merely possible kingdom of ends. I take it that, perhaps, you are imagining it violates the first one, but the first one does not involve checking maxims against what people hate. There are a few proposals about how the first formula works, but among them are things like: the maxim cannot be willed to be a universal law because...(1) it contains a logical contradiction, (2) in a world where this rule exists the proposed act is imprudent, or (3) a world where this rule exists is generally inconsistent with the agent's requirements for a world.",1223

t3_n9gau6,ELI5: Why does meat continue to increase in temperature after being removed from the oven?,gxnn3k3,The core temperature might increase but the average temperature does not. When you heat up a piece of meat you are just heating the outside. It can take some time for the heat to equalize throughout the meat. So the inside temperature can still be quite cold even if the outside is done. This is why you measure the core temperature of the meat and not the outside temperature. To prevent overcooking the outside of the meat you have to take it out of the oven.

t3_n9hk7k,[Pokémon] How come there's a population of Braviary in Route 11 if there's no female counterpart of their species?,gxo6itw,"Personally, I assume that wild pokemon in nature breed under different conditions than pokemon in captivity. Look at baby pokemon for example, you can easily find them in nature, but if you try to breed their evolved counterparts by themselves, you would skip right by the baby stage if you don't have them hold a Incense, which they most certainly don't need in nature. Or look at legendary pokemon which cannot breed at all in captivity, yet we know of several eggs or baby versions of some of them. This is especially telling in Manaphy, which which in captivity can only produce eggs containing Phione, yet we know explictly [that eggs containing Manaphy exist in nature.](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Diamond_(Adventures)#Raised) So my conclusion would that there are indeed wild pokemon that Braviary can breed with to produce eggs containing Rufflet.",868

t3_naq972,ELI5 How do accents and dialects develop so differently?,gxuyw2r,"Take a group of people, the speak the same language and all talk with pretty much the same exact accent. Now, take that group of people, split it in half, and put each half several hundred miles away from each other, or like, on two sides of a really hard to cross mountain range. These two halves will now slowly start to sound less and less alike as each half adopts new mannerisms/slang/pronunciations that could really just stem from someone mispronouncing a word and it not getting corrected and it catching on to the point where the group now believes that the correct pronunciation. And when you’re separated from the other group/not constantly talking with outside groups, those deviations don’t ever get corrected. This is essentially what happened in Australia, the great distances between Europe and Australia meant people just gradually started talking differently. Accents can also be influenced by Immigration. Places in the USA with heavy Irish, Italian, or German immigration/settlement will have the regional accent impacted by all these people. One of the examples you listed is Boston, where 1 out of every 5 people are of Irish descent, that’s a pretty good chunk of the population.",1202

t3_naqped,How can I make a bland character Interesting?,gxv1fka,"I’d like to turn your attention to the character Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. Data is not unknowledgeable per se, but as an android, he does lack significant knowledge and understanding about human behavior and especially human emotions. He is like humans, but also very dissimilar from them. This creates a dissonance within him that drives him to dedicate whatever time and energy he can spare into understanding what makes humans human, often surprising the actual humans around him with the naked insight he provides concerning the things they do and feel. For much of the series, Data is emotionless, serious, and fairly unknowledgeable; but because of the perspective he offers and the childlike innocence he has, he is one of the most beloved characters in the entire Star Trek franchise. Basically, all characters need motivation and drive to make them interesting",885

When the product (s) gets to a tank farm they will run that interface into another tank then likely introduce that into a diesel tank because the volume in the tank will dilute that interface and still.keep the product in spec (I mean a huge tank with thousands and thousands of gallons). I have worked where a pipeline comes into a tank farm and this is how they receive the different fuels. Like I say some mixing does occur but it's diluted in the large tanks. They will typically not interface with regular gas and premium because the density is too close and they would mix more.

With that sort of starting engine, you can slap a serious turbo or supercharger and easily get several hundred more HP. And again, it looks like a normal sedan. Get it in grey or silver, and you'll blend in with a crowd of camry's and maximas and focuses, whatever. The car was an utter failure for Chevy, terrible sales and they ended production of it a few years ago. No one bought it because the people in the sports car market weren't looking for a sleeper, they look for a more stylish and expensive looking car. But if you want a factory sleeper, The Chevy SS fits that bill, IMO.",815
t3_nas7xy,What's your ghost story?,gxv96xo,"This one is lengthy and will be a pain to type on phone but here goes: my buddy's house he used to live in with his parents was haunted. Some nights back when we just graduated high school, I would get a sense of uneasiness but would just listen to music and fall asleep. Then after a while, each night it grew progressively worse until the last few times of staying the night were by far terrifying. First it went from simple uneasiness to full on hearing things. I would spend the night in the guest room and have music playing in my ears all night so I wouldn't hear the sounds. Well, one night I didnt have it. I heard feet shuffling through the carpet as if someone woke up to check on me. They all slept upstairs while the guest bedroom was downstairs by bathroom, kitchen, and main door. I sat up to hear the footsteps come to the door and then stop. You can just feel it that they were peering in but NOBODY was there. Then hearing the feet shuffling back up the stairs. I tried to make nothing of it but the footsteps were loud like someone physically was making rounds. Finally after a few times, I mustered the courage to go spot them like it was my buddy trying to mess with me (just remembering brings tears into my eyes) and what I saw was not my buddy... But a pair of slightly transparent feet in socks shuffling toward me, stopping mere steps away, then turning to the bathroom on the right and walking in there. I hauled ass up to my buddy's bedroom to wake him up but he wouldn't listen. He claimed it was the wind (not windy at all), its the rain (wasnt raining that entire week), it's ANTS! (Yes, the wise man has been a marvel!) I gave up and was forced to return to the guest room terrified. How could I sleep? What can I do? I prayed and prayed, I didn't have my music player at all to distract me. I would hear the rounds again (upstairs to each room, down the stairs, in the living room, dining room, then my area then back up) but each trip they would come further into the room, watch me, then leave. First was lingering at the door, make a round then just in the door, make a round then at the foot of the bed, THEN AT MY SIDE OF THE BED! I was praying, begging, pleading for God/Jesus to help me. Finally came to the last round and final time I ever laid in that bed. After it stopped at the foot of the bed, waiting... Waiting... Not leaving... Suddenly, a terrifying sensation crept throughout my body. My fucking hair on one side of my body stood on end with goosebumps, adrenaline rushing, heart beating 100+ beats per minute, as the sensation overwhelmed me slowly from leg up to my head as it enveloped the entire side. Then out of fear I couldn't really move... I needed to, I wanted to but it was like I didn't know how... As it got worse and worse, more and more intense, you just know what is happening but can't stop or control it. You feel ""invaded"" and that horrible negative intention is outright terrifying. It's a pressure that gets more intense but you don't feel crushed. Chill down the spine, you feel the intention in the air like AC too high and malice. I eventually overcame my fear and forced my way (somehow) out of that room, rushed up to my buddy's bedroom, woke him up again, had to give him a video game of mine to convince him stay up with me as I waited to leave. Bastard still laughs at me and tells people ""lol, he thinks my old house was haunted!"" Fuck that, never again!

t3_nby2uk,What is the funniest thing you heard a teacher or professor say in class?,gy1z1r2,"This happened to a friend, but I *have* to share it. There was a very cranky math professor named Dr Z teaching a class on differential equations. He had a habit of filling every square inch of the chalkboard with notes, and would methodically work his way from the left side of the board to the right until he ran out of space, and then walk all the way left and start from the beginning again, like an IBM typewriter. At the start of one class he asked if everyone could see his writing, and one student, let's call him Derek, said ""no"" because a lectern was in the way. Dr Z, delighted that only Derek couldn't see that section of board, scribbled ""Derek is stupid"" right in the blind spot and then continued on as if nothing happened. Dr Z would also give you whatever spare change he had in his pocket if you caught a mistake while he was lecturing—or alternatively, throw his chalk at you if he turned around and caught you on your phone. He was a lifelong vegetarian and would often lecture barefoot or in socks during the winter. He maintains a blog with hundreds upon hundreds of mathematical hot takes, and he's been updating it continuously since the late 90s. I took a couple classes with him, easily one of the strangest people I have ever met (but a great professor nonetheless)",1292
t3_nby7r5,ELI5 - How Can Eyes Shift Focus Like A Camera?,gy20wa1,"There are multiple parts of the eye that help to bend the light and make the image on the retina. One of these elements is right behind the visible pupil or iris. It is called the lens but, confusingly, it is just one of the parts that is helping to bend the light into focus. It is important for its ability to change shape though. When the lens gets pulled on by some small muscles it changes shape from more curved to less curved. This variation in shape changes the focusing distance of the whole eye assembly. A stretched, less round, lens causes targets that are far away to be in focus while a relaxed, more bulbous, lens leads to things closer to the eye being in focus.",678

The physics comes in handy when thinking about units, spectral content of light, light and surface interactions, things like that. As far as on the job stuff, thats a huge part of day to day. I had to teach myself solidworks, as well as alot of the structure of the company. Like how to utilize all the members of the company effectively to get tasks done. It's a small company and it's very self managed. You have to ask for help when you need it. Like I'm not great at electronics, or if the programming gets tough it's not practical to tackle it myself.

t3_nchh0h,Does Making a Man Wait Really Earn his Respect?,gy52atj,"I personally think the idea is foolish. If you want to sleep with someone, then do it. Simple as that. Ideally, you vet the person enough in order to still maintain some level of standards, but that's completely subjective. I have two competing thoughts on the subject. To be a bit crass (but honest), one thought that always crosses my mind is that if a girl sleeps with me that easily, then she is probably sleeping with other guys that easily as well. But on the other hand, if a girl really likes me and ""makes me wait"" but at the same time isn't making other guys wait, then how much can she really like me? And for the record, I think both of these thoughts are completely unfair and recognize that it has a lot to do with my own ego. I'm not someone who views sex as something that *necessarily* needs to be special. I try to treat men and women equally. If I don't look down on a guy who sleeps around but I do if a girl does it, then that isn't exactly fair. But at the same time, if I ever were to look for something more serious then I would want to feel both that a) she is actually attracted to me, and b) that she has vetted me enough to suggest that she actually is looking for more than just something casual.",1225

t3_ncx8fg,[The Matrix] How is every Zion called Zion?,gy9qzzu,"There a theory that Zion is actually in the Matrix and that the Matrix as we know it... Is actually a Matrix within a Matrix.

It also explains why Neo is able to control/destroy Sentinels wirelessly in the ""real world"". Additionally, the Architect specifically tells Neo that he must take people and rebuild ""Zion"", so, if he gives every 'The One' this same spiel, then it implies that the city has always been named Zion and that the current 'The One' just continues this naming. ""Zion"" is a biblical word. It means 'the promised land' and if you consider the Matrix Within a Matrix theory, then it dovetails nicely that this is all part of a system of control: The machines build a 2 layer Matrix and give humans the option to ""escape"" layer 2 to go to ""the promised land"" which is really in Layer 1, hence they never actually leave the *real* Matrix at all.",971

I hated that name and he didn’t at all even look when it was said. He’s a shih tsu who gets fluffy with curls when his fur grows out—as he’s mixed with an unknown other type. He genuinely looks like a teddy bear with light tan champagne color. I didn’t want to call him bear as I had a dog when I was little with that name, and I was also taking an okanowian form of karate and into Japanese culture. (Plus knew shih tsu were asian). So I started to look for some foreign Asians translated words. Hi name is Kuma-Inu which is bear dog in Japanese.",633

Which, don't get me wrong, is great, but I saw almost no one talking about Cameron Diaz's performance. She was so good she really *was* unrecognizable and I was convinced that some people didn't even realize it was her.

Rocket is an explosives expert with access to space travel, it would not be overwhelmingly difficult for him to fly up and destroy the ship. Loki’s invasion plan was to use the Space Stone to send the Chitauri in with their mothership on the other side of the galaxy.

t3_ne5j27,Eli5 How do cellphones connect to each other?,gyem9rq,"Well, for a start, the communication between the phone and the cell tower is the only point where you need to keep the signals separate--the communication between the towers is using high-bandwidth links that can easily carry a massive volume of calls. Since each tower is only likely to be handling a few thousand phones (since there are a \*lot\* of towers) and not all of those phones will simultaneously be making calls, they don't need anywhere near as much bandwidth. It \*is\* possible for cell towers to get overwhelmed if a lot of people do call at the same time, though, which happens often in major emergency situations. For this reason the cellphone company will prioritise what data goes through the cell tower. Emergency calls take precedence over other voice calls, which in turn take precedence over data, which is why you'll often still be able to make a call even if your phone is unable to connect to the Internet.",933

I've worked similar jobs in the past, and faces can tend to bleed together and you don't really view any one single customer as an individual, as opposed to just another customer. This often translates to ambivalence, no eye contact, greeting, smile, or farewell, and a simple mechanical, emotionless transaction. While I understand it, it is slightly annoying.

t3_neorf9,Am I right in interpreting Aristotle's ethics as egoistic?,gyhklr0,"I strongly disagree. tldr: From Aristotle’s point of view, the highest good is Eudaimonia. The English translation of eudaimonia is “happiness,” which incorrectly implies that eudaimonia is not just feeling happy or experiencing pleasure. Achieving eudaimonia is to fulfill our unique potential as human beings... Happiness, in this case, is not only about pleasure. It is the condition of flourishing as a human being. It is the only human good that is desirable for its own sake, and all other goods are desirable for the sake of achieving eudaimonia. Therefore, eudaimonia is an end in itself. That is what he means when he says “goods correspond to ends.” According to Aristotle, every living being has a unique function that distinguishes it from all other beings. He claims that a being’s highest good does not lie in just performing the function, but performing the function well and in order to function well, it has to perform in accordance with virtue. Aristotle identifies the human function as the soul’s activity that expresses reason. Therefore, the highest good for humans is the soul’s rational activity that expresses virtue. The highest good is not two things. It isn’t soul’s rational activity that expresses virtue AND Eudaimonia. Eudaimonia consists of fulfilling the human function. Let me know what you think.",1332
t3_neorsj,What things were contraband in your school but people snuck in anyway?,gyhab60,"I went to a boarding school in the early 2000s. One of the things that was considered contraband was music in any form MP3, CDs, etc. They were so strict about this that they would actually root through our rooms and our computers to make sure we didn't have music. Buy my Junior and Senior year I had made friends with the right people including staff so that I could circumvent these rules. (For example my laptop was never checked but approved anyway.) I was also tipped off anytime they were doing a room search. During my senior year me and another kid were making bootleg CD copies for our friends right under everyone's nose. For all my trouble I got 200 albums from him absolutely free. We were the audio equivalent of Al Capone!

Petroleum (Oil) was primary formed in the age of the dinosaurs but from zooplankton and algae in large shallow seas. The oxygen level in the was very low on the bottom or sediments cover stuff there faster then they could decompose. Dinosaurs lived on land.

The controllers that run the electromagnets most likely have some form of protective relay or fuse that would blow if a large enough current is pushed through as well. There is also plenty of other conducting material to shield some of the internals. Overall, I don't this there is any active protection for maglevs against CMEs and if it gets the point where they are affected you have much larger problems to worry about such as planes falling from the sky.",865

t3_nisz78,"Thinking about quitting academia, how to go about it?",gz5835o,"FWIW, it sounds to me that you are doing well. What you say about the toxic review process and your supervisor sounds ok. The fact is, you are still a Ph.D. student and so it is probably true that some of your ideas that you spend a year and a half on will seem half-baked. That's not an insult, it's just that people keep maturing and developing significantly for years *after* the Ph.D., so it seems to me perfectly imaginable that a reviewer with high standards could find some of the work of a very good Ph.D. student in the 4th year to be half-baked. And though I know that there is more publication in graduate school these days, your advisor might be right to encourage you to slow down a bit. It might be that he/she thinks that 3 really good publications are better than 6 in mid-tier journals. Maybe that is true (but it isn't my field so I don't know). I am not generally one to encourage people to get Ph.D.'s, but since you have done 4 years, it might be good to finish (if it is not too painful) and have the degree, start preparing yourself for a switch, and at that time apply to different kinds of jobs and see what happens.

To answer your first, no; if something has a scent, as long as there is any piece of that thing, it will have that scent. If it's reduced to a few molecules, it might be too faint for humans to smell with our noses, but the scent is there, however faint, until the molecules are removed or converted into different molecules. Spoiled fish smells bad due to bacteria decomposition, not the fish, so that's why your second question isn't very accurate. When the bacteria completely decompose the fish so that there are no more fish molecules, then the scent of the fish will be gone. Long before then, the odor of the bacterial byproducts will overwhelm our sense of smell and make us throw out the fish. Eventually the bacterial byproducts would stop smelling when they became broken down into other materials, but that would take a while. Please don't perform this experiment.",925

t3_nlcv2k,Does listening to audiobooks count as “reading?” What do you guys think that listening to a book is better or reading a book?,gzi6o7m,"The question answers itself. You used the verb ""listening"". So it's not reading, because we already have this other word to describe it. This only bothers people who make a fetish of reading and who think it has some virtue that mere listening doesn't. As to which is better, it depends on the context. For academic reading, a physical book or e-book is better because you can stop and think about it, annotate the text, reread passages to grasp every nuance, cross-reference texts, etc. much easier than with audiobooks. But for the kind of reading for entertainment that most people do, audiobooks and physical books/e-books are equivalent. Audiobooks can even be superior for some purposes. For example, I'm currently doing a project to read all of Shakespeare's plays. I start by reading Marjorie Garber's *Shakespeare After All*, each chapter of which analyzes a different play, then read the corresponding play in a facsimile edition of the First Folio, and finally listen to the audiobook in the Arkangel Shakespeare series to get a sense of what each play is like in performance. Obviously I can't get a sense of what it's actually like in performance if I'm not at least hearing it performed (though I can and do invent imaginary productions in my head as I'm reading). However, in order to consider the plays as literary works, I'm *also* reading the texts and reading analysis of the texts.",1401

Both these theories are about how we should understand Moral vocabulary. So what they want to know is what we are actually doing when using Moral vocabulary. A wholly different question, and that is what you seem to be after, is the question in Moral psychology about what people think they are doing when using Moral vocabulary. On this first linguistic reading about what people actually do when using Moral vocabulary, the two theories you cited are clearly opposed. We can not actually claim something truth evaluable and at the same time not truth evuable.

t3_nlvy0t,Is Utilitarianism really that bad?,gzl404y,"&gt; I am reading 'An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation' by Bentham right now, but whenever I hear people saying utilitarianism is stupid, I feel really bad about reading it. Don't feel bad for reading Bentham, he's an important philosopher. Read utilitarians, both because utilitarianism is a significant and still pretty popular philosophical view, and because there are many utilitarian philosophers who are important to understanding contemporary ethical philosophy, like Bentham, Mill, Paley, Sidgwick, Singer, etc. &gt; One of the main ones I hear is that there are certain things that are obviously unjust, but would be permissible according to Utilitarianism. I don't get this one, isn't the response to that just... no, it isn't unjust (assuming they don't give you an actual reason why said thing is unjust, but only say what I wrote above)? That's what the utilitarian will have to say, but think about it this way: if I say things that sound obviously wrong all the time, and when called out on it I say it follows from willbellianism, wouldn't you just say ""I don't care, you're still obviously wrong, and how frequently you're obviously wrong is a mark against willbellianism""? &gt; And when they do give a reason I find that, whether they know it or not, the reason is Utilitarian itself. Utilitarians make arguments of this kind, but I think the claim is *prima facie* implausible. You can possibly consequentialize deontological theories, but most philosophers wouldn't say that makes their reasons utilitarian. Even authors that are optimistic about consequentializing don't really seem to believe that (e.g. ""In defense of consequentializing"" by Dreier).",1696

t3_nm6rf1,"ELI5: If photons have no mass, why are they affected by gravity?",gzmt3py,"Hi! In the theory of General Relativity (GR), gravity is not a force at all, but a curvature of spacetime. To understand how a curvature of spacetime can lead to the effects we observe around us, we have to understand how curved surfaces change the behaviour of straight lines. First things first: an object that has no force acting on it is force-free. Force-free objects do not accelerate and, therefore, move along straight lines. In a flat geometry, two straight lines which are parallel at one point will remain parallel for all times. That is, two parallel straight lines will never cross on a flat surface. So far so intuitive, right? But what happens, if those straight lines do not move across a flat surface, but instead along a curved surface? We call such straight lines on curved surfaces [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic). Imagine a [sphere](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/%7Edwh/books/eg99/Ch06/3776c40d.jpg) with two lines perpendicular to the equator. As they are both perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel at that altitude. Imagine two objects that are moving along the lines perpendicular to the equator. They start out parallel, and move in a straight line upwards. Despite the fact that neither of them is turning, the two objects that started out moving along parallel lines will meet at the north pole. Hence, despite the fact that both objects are force-free at all times, they experience relative acceleration. Such trajectories, that lead across curved surfaces without turning are called geodesics and they can be thought of as straight lines on curved surfaces. Objects under the influence of gravity follow [geodesics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic). As gravity curves spacetime, geodesics can experience relative acceleration despite the fact, that both objects following said geodesics are force-free. And this relative acceleration of force-free bodies is what Newton mistook for the gravitational force. According to GR, though, there is no force, only curvature which causes force-free objects to move along paths that seem accelerated to outside observers. This is why gravity is a fictitious force: The reason why two objects in a gravitational field may experience relative acceleration is not a force between them, but geodesic deviation between two force-free objects. **That is why photons are affected by gravity: photons follow geodesics through spacetime, and the presence of mass-energy curves spacetime. Therefore, the straight lines that photons follow through this curved spacetime appears curved to outside observers.** If you have any more specific questions, feel free to ask. ----- For a great video on the basics of GR, check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NblR01hHK6U) video by PBS Spacetime.",2792

t3_nmh8ar,What advice and product / setup recommendations do you have for someone about to start working from home for the first time?,gzopc17,"if you can find a room to do all of you work in, like a home office, if not have a designated area for your work. make sure you not sat near a TV or a front window on to a road ( I seem to get easily distracted by things outside on a long day) but near a window is good, especially to have it open a jar. also get a good chair, you'll thank yourself later. and try to be so your arms are almost at 90ish degree angles from you body to the desk/ keyboard, as bring lower also decreases slouching.",495
t3_nmkq8w,What is your most interesting babysitting story?,gzp5scn,"Many a year ago I watched a little 3-4 year old girl who *loved* Barney. She had several VHS tapes (yes I'm that old) of Barney and her mom said anytime she got fussy or whatever to just start up one of the tapes, one of which was usually always in the VCR. One day, I went to start one of the tapes while I made dinner and....it was not Barney. It was an adult film. A particularly raunchy one. I managed to get the tape stopped without her seeing any of it (I think) and just popped one of the Barney ones in. I debated saying anything but I finally decided I better and just sort of said ""Um, when I went to put Barney in earlier there was a different movie already in the VCR that I didn't think you'd like her to watch and I left it on top of the TV"" and nothing else was ever said. Never saw the tape again though.",820

t3_nmm4wv,How do you write someone singing / a song being sung in a story?,gzph3x5,"Is it playing through a stereo system / radio or is someone actually singing it? Usually when music plays in movies like that, it’s in the background as ambience, to contribute to the overall atmosphere. That is indeed kind of difficult to capture in a 2D format like books, you can’t get the full 360 degree texture that you would when you can engage your visual and aural senses. But this is how I usually I do it. Since the music in movies is often background noise, you don’t really need to put the actual lyrics in writing, because odds are that your characters aren’t paying that close attention anyways. Usually, it will do good enough to say that the character heard a song they recognized (maybe mention the name of the song), heard a catchy/sweet/sensual/bopping melody etc. Use descriptive words to capture the texture of the melody, the singer’s voice, and so on, as it would be perceived by the character If the song has importance in some way, then maybe you can insert the relevant portion of the lyrics, but like you say, you can’t really “hear” them, so it risks lessening the impact. I totally get where you’re coming from, because I’ll often find myself trying to give my stories a movie-esque atmosphere, and run into problems exactly like this.

t3_nn4bmn,ELI5: How does an automobile's gearing affect its torque versus its top speed?,gzsg7q5,"If you've ever ridden a bicycle with gears you can get a really direct example of this. If you go uphill, it's REALLY difficult in a higher gear, in a lower gear you can peddle easily and get your mass moving but you'll have to peddle faster doing it. Same for a car, with the ""effort"" in modern engines being analogous to dumping in more fuel in an attempt to provide enough power until the point it bogs down or the torque converter just starts slipping. Conversely, you can only peddle so fast no matter how little effort it can take and engines can only run at so high an RPM. So if you're not trying to get up a hill, pull something heavy, whatever, that low gear will leave you spinning like mad but not getting anywhere fast, you've got to spin the tires more times to speed up and you can't spin the power source any faster so you change the ratio of power source spins to wheel spins, ie you shift into a higher gear. ""Overdrive"" refers to this ratio going beyond 1.0, meaning the transmission output is spinning more than 1 time, maybe 1.1 for example, for every rotation of the engine/pedals. Really fast cars need to have a high max RPM and hogh available gear ratios to avchieve those speeds while making enough power to fight things like air resistance, the rolling resistance of tires and the friction in the drivetrain. Cars also have a gearing in the axle, usually somewhere in the 3-4 ish range, which means that for every 3-4 rotations of the transmission output, the wheela will rotate once. This has the same relationship to speed/power as the transmission ratio. Numerically higher axle ratios (more driveshaft turns per wheel turn) provide a mechanical advantage for power, but require a higher RPM to achieve the same speed, all else equal. These higher numbers are seen in trucks, off road vehicles trying to fight the inertia of large tires, and drag vehicles where acceleration is prioritized over high top speed (up to a point of diminishing returns anyway). You'll also often see higher axle gearing in vehicles with the smallest available engine for that model since it allows the manufacturer to provide more mechanical advantage to the weak engine without having to build a different transmision with more advantageous gear ratios. Numerically lower ratios are seen in high cruising speed cars and in commuter vehicles that want to either maximize speed at a given RPM (optimizing for high cruise speed) OR that are trying to maximize fuel efficiency while cruising (lower rpm for a given speed means the cylinders firing fewer times means less fuel used). Gearing is always a trade off. You can only go so low before it's imptactically slow and demands way too high an RPM from the engine. You can only go so high before the engine can't produce enough power to keep the vehicle moving, it eventually needs more mechanical advantage from the gears to get the job done.",2901
t3_nn770w,"ELI5: People build computers, swapping out parts when they become obsolete, why can't we do the same thing with mobile phones?",gzsxbum,Personal computers have been around a while (80’s) and the market for their standardized components has established itself over time. Those first computers weren’t very upgradable either. Phones are kind of the same thing and their size makes things more complicated. Also phone makers have zero interest or benefit for users upgrading their phone with third-party upgrades. Mainly because they’d rather people pay them for new phones every two years.,451

And don't I dare raise my voice! And then he was somehow wondering why I took my mom on weekend-trips to cities, and left him out. Uhmmm...maybe because mom was nice?

So my advice for this summer is to read a variety of books representing different traditions and periods: ancient, medieval, modern, analytical, continental, pragmatism, Eastern as well as looking into different branches from aesthetics and feminism to the philosophy of mind. If that's too much to put on your plate, simply select a reasonable variety and read as voraciously as possible. If you're going into analytical, you're going to have to read Kripke and Quine at some point, so you may want to start with them. You haven't said what you've read, but Plato is always a good point of entrance broadly speaking. And if you develop any curiosity about continental, I recommend Nietzsche and Camus as highly provocative and entertaining material. Save Hegel and Heidegger for later, haha!",1002

I checked on him the next morning. When he saw me, he crawled up the side of the cage to the door and began banging on the cage. He wanted me to pick him up, so I did. It became clear that he actually couldn't walk anymore, and he exhausted his energy by banging on the cage door and climbing into my arms. My husband and I put him on a heating pack, and patted him. He licked my fingers, then rolled over and died. I cried for days. It still hurts.

t3_nozkpa,"Does hardship make a person stronger? If so, under what condition and at what point is it too much hardship?

But I definitely dislike the whole idea the strength comes from the hardships because either it came from stable surroundings you had before the hardships came and which made you prepared and more resilient or from the resources you managed to discover during and despite the hardships. Cruel times itself don't have any positive effect, they only hurt and weaken a person. But the idea that there's something good coming from them creates a climate where people live with the strange believe that people 'fail' during difficult times by searching for help, that they are somehow weak because hey, hardships are a chance for growth! They make you stronger if you just push through. And that's just utter nonsense. Its also harmful because it leads to people in distress not asking for help or too late and avoid therapy and other nonsense because they somehow feel that this would be a form of failure, that they have to endure and solve hardships all on their own to become somehow stronger. When I finally accepted help and got therapy the hardest thing was to understand that true strength means knowing your limits and search help when they're reached. Also that there's more wisdom and strength in acceptance than in denial. Sometimes I feel as if that notion is used by people who don't have many hardships to weasel out of giving help when asked. If you really need someone and they give you that line it's just as if they say: ''Hey don't worry, it'll make you stronger! Just tough it out and go away. You don't need me!'",1599

t3_noxvpv,Emotional toll of not releasing work regularly?,h02l93f,"It's not an uncommon sort of incipient block. You're probably hoping you'll be great and admired for the greatness, or afraid people will notice your mistakes, and it's twisting you up. Thus the ""tossing"" feeling. Try not to feel either of those ways. Try not to think about the future. Stay in the moment. Just write, often, quickly. In so doing, you'll pile on the words, and more words mean more skill, and A+ work will come from that even if what you're producing now is solid B work. Once I was good enough to be commercial published, and when I switched ten years later to self-publishing, where releasing at least every 3 months is crucial to keeping your audience excited, I realized, ""Good enough is good enough."" It became one of my writing mantras. No more endless revisions. Get it done, get it pro proofread, and let the audience decide. At worst, you'll hit your stride one day and decide to take down the old stuff because you're doing much better now. Or, at worst, I suppose you'd need a new pen name because the old stuff was truly gawdawful people were traumatized by it, but that's highly unlikely. Still, one could do that too, and leave the embarrassing stuff behind. Write at least 1000 words per day. Study the craft somehow. (read how-to books; do close structural analyses of your favorite books; find a great summer workshop; whatever.) All else will follow. Try sprints. When it's a Nano month, they run sprints on their twitter feed. There are sprinting groups out there on the web. You write fast, and outwrite your self-conscious feelings that way.

There’s *so* much more to know to fully understand the Titans. The thing is… I can’t tell you. Because if I did, I’d be giving you major spoilers. I’d be telling you what *I* (a person who goes into the Internet the exact second a new chapter of the manga is released) have discovered recently. I assume you’ve only watched the anime. Okay, so the anime stops in **chapter 33** of the manga. We discover the truth about Titans in **chapter 86**. If I told you, I’d go and ruin you ***53 chapters of 40 pages each*** —or season two of the anime, and probably season three as well. And, believe me, it’s a very big deal what’s happening here. Like, a **titanic** (*wink*) **deal**. There are things that just make you drop the laptop and say out loud, “Wow. Isayama’s mind is so fucked up. This whole story is so fucked up. But it’s *brilliant*, and actually makes so much sense.” ***And*** *they’ll make sense only if you know what has been happening since chapter 33.* So. Want to know what the Titans’ motives are?

If you have a solid story premise that would work for a novel, go for it! If you have an itch to blog, blog! If you want to practice your writing muscles, fanfiction can be great since you should already know the characters really well and can focus on the other aspects of writing, while also figuring out how to keep characters’ arcs consistently believable. So if you want to try it, try it! Do what you want. The more important thing IMO is not what you write, but learning to write consistently. Try to write for at least 15 minutes five days out of the week, everyday is even better. It’s a great way to build a habit without too much pressure or reasons to resist.",748

t3_n305ge,Eli5: What determines if a metal produces an oxide layer?,gwn80jm,"I can't really do it for an actual 5 year old level, but here is an explanation: They all produce an oxide layer (noble metals aside) What matters is whether it's protective or not. By that I mean: does the oxide coating protect the underlying metal from further oxidation? And whether it does or not turns out to be largely a function of how much volume change the material undergoes when it oxidizes. If the volume change ratio is above and close to 1, it's protective, if it's any amount under, or over by too much (I forget the exact ratio, 1.5 or 2 or something?) It's not protective. Volume ratio of Aluminum to its oxide : protective Volume ratio of iron to it's oxide : not protective The mechanical properties of the oxide also have an effect if there is any sort of rubbing or wear on the surface (protective oxide that keeps getting rubbed off is not super effective) And if there is anything like salt water around, all bets are off, it'll corrode, ""protective oxide layer"" be damned!",996

But its shady as hell that you let him inside your home. If some stranger of the opposite sex invited my 8 year old kid inside their home I would be PISSED. This could easily be seen as grooming behaviour without you intending that at all. Think about it. You went swimming with him. You invited him into your home without his parents knowing. You're hanging out with him because you literally have no idea how to tell him to piss off. Be careful how you interact with this kid. The relationship you are forming is not seen as a healthy relationship for him to have by society. You seem like a nice person but you need to nip this in the bud. Hes a child. You cant invite him into your home like that without his parents knowing. And the converter being stolen is actually a pretty common new theft among low lifes.

I joined the site just to salute (what the internet used to call taking proof photos) in order to get a fake account of me off it. The forums were uncensored and had a lot of hilarious people so I stayed for them. It was partly embarassing because of the cringy name, but mostly because we actually met because his friend from the site had me call him one night when I was homeless. He took me in sight unseen, across the continent and in another country, five hours later. So like.. there was no noninvasive way to discuss how we met so we just fell back on the half truth which was embarrassing in itself lol.",814

Honestly the only thing that helped me was time, I tried to pretty much immediately make myself feel better by feeling around for other potential relationships but if I knew then what I know now I wouldn't have done that. Because even after talking to a guy for like two weeks and he decided he wasn't interested, that reopened the still kinda fresh wound and I absolutely lost it again. So just give yourself some time to heal and once you stop thinking about them constantly, you know you've moved on. You'll never completely forget about them tho and that's okay.

Or put better, ""Am I more likely to make this situation better or worse?"". If better, help. If worse, call for help / recommend an expert. You continue to ask this question at various steps in the process, not just once. I've been involved in many projects, some I see all the way through, some end in or have steps of ""get the opinion of a lawyer / engineer / accountant"". Couple that with, ""How did I fail?"" and ""How can I improve?"". Toss in that last question EVEN WHEN YOU SUCCEED. You lose the fear of failure using those two steps: accept it is normal and WILL happen sometimes AND mitigate the risk of failure by using outside help when you need it.",918

All that for a decoration that's about a foot or two tall. Somebody else mentioned Funko pops which I have a few of. A tenner for a small, easily storable, fairly sturdy decorative statue based on some character you like. It's not particularly expensive and certainly won't break the bank. They're appealing for the same reasons posters appeal to people except pops are more convenient since you don't have to hang them up or have each one take up a big chunk of your wall. The idea of spending a grand on a decorative statue that does the same thing just because it's a wee bit bigger and has some extra detail is utterly absurd though.",862

Out of state tuition is often 3 times the cost, absolutely no reason to pay that, you get the same degree. you don't spend decades paying off student loans the size of a rent payment if you have another option. DO NOT worry where your friends go. Very few stay friends with their high school friends even once you go off to college. Kids have gone across the country to be with friends only to have the friend say a month later they want to find a new crowd. people change so much not many friendships and relationships continue, this is not a reason to put yourself thousands more in debt. Do not throw money away on a school you don't need to, especially if you can't go all 4 years. Imagine not being able to take family on vacation or buy a house in a decade because you wanted to go to an out of state school. That is the reality for many 30 year olds, the payment for student loans is just too high to save for a house or kids. ""I just wanna get outta here"" leaevs many kids screwed for years. Do not leave a safe environment where you can save money. Over half of people under age 30 are living with mom and dad due to high cost of living. You can do it when you are in school and it does not matter, or you can move back in later when you are trying to get married or have a kid and realize you can't do it with such high student loans.",1485

I was daydreaming about an Edgar Allen Poe story (as usual) and did not hear my teacher explain that I was supposed to *keep* the book. When it came time to leave, I left without my book. The next day I realized my mistake. But every book on the shelf was gone. So I just left again without one. They thought I was being belligerent by not doing my homework. But I really just didn't have a book, so I couldn't access the assignments, and I was petrified to admit my mistake. I was so socially awkward, and used to being bullied, that I never asked for help--even though my teacher seemed kind. I flunked the class. They put me in remedial classes. And that f\*cked me up in the head enough to not care anymore. So I sat in those classes and daydreamed, too.

There are probably plenty of people who could potentially have had the skill to be professional writers but never tried, or waited until they were much older because the elders/authority figures in their lives discouraged them. I don’t think people look down on writing as a job. If you can manage to make a living off writing, it’s impressive. But it is rare, because there are a lot of talented hopefuls compared to the number of jobs, so saying you want to be a writer is often associated with naïveté.

They just ignored everything on my resume and decided I was a CNC machinist. After a couple of supervisors argued about who wanted the 'CNC machinist' I finally got a word in edgewise that I was NOT one, they actually asked me what I had experience doing and threw me on the factory floor approximately five minutes later. They were so certain about me being a machinist. I feel like I could have just said yes and pretended to know what I was doing. After working there a while it appeared that our electricians where already doing that.",823

t3_n7kiqh,How to represent a full year story in a short novel?,gxdasay,"If you mean that you have scenes that take place, like here and there over the course of a year you could add some clues to what season it is by describing temperature or weather, what character are wearing or if relevant mentioning a recent or upcoming holiday or event. If you naturally include it in descriptions, inner dialogue and conversation it should effectively help the reader feel the passage of time without it distracting from the story. Just make sure it makes sense to your setting and characters! Or you could title each chapter with a date. Some people seem to have something against it, others don’t read or pay attention to it. I don’t have an opinion on it really but it is an idea!",702

t3_n7sa7n,Is there ”class diversity” among philosophers in academical institutions?,gxejl1j,"&gt; If it is the case that philosophers do come from a privileged background, will that affect their look on, well, philosophy? More than likely yes. And this is something which many philosophers do recognize, to various degrees. (Recognizing and actually knowing what to do about it, especially if one is from such a privileged background, are of course two different things.) There is some class diversity in philosophy and there are definitely philosophers, including some very prominent ones, whose socio-economic background is not at all one of privilege. But that said, philosophy still has a huge problem in this respect, and this is also pretty widely acknowledged (again, doesn't mean it's always being successfully addressed.) There are all sorts of obstacles that probably keep people from less advantaged backgrounds from making it in academic philosophy - something which is tough to do even for those who don't face these obstacles!",947

What advice and reassurance do you have for grad students with ADHD worried about their own future?",gxh7k5b,"Well, I wouldn't say I've ""made it,"" but I'm doing ok! Everyone's advice to work with your own rhythm is spot on. I take my pomodoro method one step further and have an app that blocks certain apps on my computer while I'm working, I highly recommend that. Also, I have an email client that compiles all of my email into an app with minimal bells and whistles, and it also keeps me off our web-based email service. I see my email at many points through the day, but I only answer three times a day. Once in the morning, I spend ~30 minutes dealing with email. Once around 2pm I'll respond to messages that have come in. And then once again around 7 (from home; it's unavoidable). Somedays I skip one (or even 2) of these email sessions, depending on what's in my inbox or how busy my day is. But this helps me massively, because I will go down an email rabbit hole, much in the same way I am writing you a novel now... And definitely find your work rhythm and productivity windows. My work schedule is something like this: Wake up and putz around my house talking to and watering my plants while I drink coffee. During this time I'm actually going through all the tings I want to do in the day in my head. It seems like such a trivial part of the day, but on days where I can't have time to myself in the morning to think and talk to myself, I'm off. Then I start work, at home, in my PJs most of the time, but I have a dedicated work station at home. Emails always. Then some writing or lecture fixing; any work I need to get done but don't need to be on campus to do. Then, I do need to get to campus at some point. So, I shower (sometimes exercise) get dressed and go to work. This is a good little break for me. (This also works out because the custodians who got to campus at like 2 am are now going home for the day, and are just leaving their primo parking spots). When I get to my office/lab I am ready to work again, hopefully. I typically take a B vitamin (Floradix) here too; its totally anecdotal, but I feel like it helps me focus and to feel less tired. I try to force myself to take regular breaks for lunch, and I like to go for a walk to get coffee in the afternoons. My point being-- I have a weird work schedule, but it *works* for me. The hardest part of productivity for me is that I really want to uni-task. I want to devote all of my time and attention to say, my paper revisions, but that can't really happen because there are classes to teach, and committees to snooze through. When I am struggling, I will look at my calendar and figure out if I can swing a day that I can block out to just devote to the one thing I want to really really delve into.",2676

There are some discussions about this in SEP: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-responsibility/#UltiResp As for allies to Strawson, I know of at least [one](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-010-9578-0).

Don't give up or get too caught up in how to avoid the scrapes. Just keep writing. 2. that said, advice can be absolutely golden. I particularly enjoyed Writing Down the Bones by Natalie Goldberg, particularly her tips for establishing a writing practice that gets you to the good stuff. The audiobook is great, because there are extra tips and reflection after some years of the book being out. 3. I do actually know a youtube series that is a treasure trove of good tips. It isn't focused on avoiding amateur mistakes, but rather being able to start telling the stories you want to tell without letting yourself or your inexperience get in the way too much.

By 1922, the IRA had essentially harried the English enough that Ireland was conceded to the Irish, save the six counties of Ulster that have a higher protestant/pro-English population than the rest. So technically, it was Ireland that split off from Northern Ireland, not the other way around... and it still took decades for an uneasy peace to be reached - while Ireland became independent in 1922, Northern Ireland remains a point of contention, though fortunately one that is having a lot fewer bombs thrown about in recent years.

t3_n9ean4,[Star Wars] How large is the memory bank of an astromech like R2? He’s seen so much. How can he remember so much information?,gxny5vp,"Astromech droids have a comparatively massive amount of storage space, given their highly technical jobs. They must be able to store a huge variety of not only blueprints and instructions for repairing thousands of different systems, but hyperspace navigational computations and other large complex files. Many astromechs are manufactured with only the bare minimum information installed (which is still a lot), and the owners are expected to either manually upload any necessary information to them, or allow their own internal learning systems to handle things that weren't programmed into them. Because of this, many astromechs have a very large amount of empty space at all times. And properly maintained astromechs who get regular memory wipes keep it that way. R2D2 could likely run for many more decades or centuries before running out of storage. It also helps that astromechs don't need to hold such extraneous information like speech patterns and multiple languages like protocol droids do. While someone could absolutely program an astromech to speak Basic, it's usually not worth the effort.",1103

Something could always happen that makes one or both of you want to back out. As far as catching feelings, that's all about what you want for yourself far more than it's about the person. If you're a lonely person who feels like you need a boyfriend/girlfriend and to tell yourself you're in love and you have a soulmate and that whole deal, you'll probably romanticize the person and the relationship and pine for them. If you're not and you don't, you're probably fine because what you want is to have fun and do some specific things. (For example, making out. Or cuddling. Or maybe you drop L-bombs because it's a turn on for one of you. Hypothetically, of course. Ahem. Or you like holding hands. You get the idea.) And you do those because they're also fun.

The bottling company would pick them up, sanitize and refill them at their plant. We did this all the time. I had an uncle who would go along the road side and collect unbroken refundable bottles for spare change (he was just a kid at the time, too). I seem to recall this phasing out sometime in the early to mid-80s with the onset of plastic bottles and aluminum cans becoming more popular.

There's also the question of... to what extent is the organisation responsible for coming up with an infrastructure based solution to that sort of problem? - e.g. email authentication, systems and processes, IT use policies - to limit your exposure there.

There's an acceptable level of inaccuracy in both electronics and machinery, but they can both move out of position. In machinery, this could be a 1mm tolerance for wobble on each part, but once it gets to 3mm it'll bind up. If you have (4) parts the first part going back and forth +1 to - 1 is just fine. But if it leans a bit, over time it'll nudge the second one towards the + side more often, so that next one is bouncing between +2 and 0. That's not ideal, but still works. Each movement it leans farther from ideal. Eventually a part ends up being a problem because it's been nudged too far by repeated action. Stopping everything let's it all fall back into the starting rest position. By starting at zero those little nudges have all been removed (until they work back in). In electronics, for various reasons a piece of data can get stuck or simply not reset to it's default position. Think of a 3way light switch. If you usually use one switch, you know which way is usually on for that one. If someone flipped the other switch and did not flip it back, now your usual switch is backwards.

t3_nbhhux,"ELI5: In music, what is the difference between remixing and remastering an album?",gxzjs4f,"Mixing is the process of taking everything you recorded and deciding how you want all those tracks to fit together. This includes each individual track's EQ, compression, effects, panning, and volume compared to other tracks. Once you have the final mix, which is all the tracks bounced down to a single track, you send that track to be mastered. Mastering involves sending that track through equipment (or plugins) and adjusting the overall track's EQ and compression so that it sounds great on all kinds of listening devices (headphones, computer speakers, high end speakers). Now that audio technology is digital, there are newer tools for manipulating, editing, and visualizing sound than when the Beatles recorded their albums. I imagine the original stems (each part of a mix, like drums, vocals, guitars) were digitized and cleaned up using computers algorithms to make the tracks sound clearer. Once you remix tracks, you have to master the new mix as well.",965

t3_nczzvq,What is required for someone to be able to use magic?,gy7x9jy,"For the average person, it is just learning. It takes a lot of practice, you need to learn the incantations and the hand motions, but more importantly you need to train yourself to align your mind and spirit with the magic you’re attempting to do. This is why Dr. Strange struggled at first, he thought it was him just memorizing what to do and he figured he could master it because he’s a genius. The Ancient One shows him that he needs to get his mind frame shifted, which he does and then becomes a quick study. So the average person IS capable of learning magic, it’s just a difficult process that involves study and practice and personal spiritual development. There is one very distinct person capable of using magic without study and practice - a natural mutant who was using her abilities at a small level until they were awakened and amplified via exposure to the Mind Stone. She’s named in the Darkhold as the Scarlet Witch - a natural practitioner of chaos magic. This type of magic is not just learnable like the others. But if you’re an ordinary person who practices you could do the same type of magic as Dr. Strange or Agatha Harkness, they’re just better at it than normal people.",1196

My mom let me wear a gorgeous, vintage, designer dress she had worn to her college dance so that was nice, and he picked me up in a cute sports car. We met up with a group of other nerds who also had to scrounge up dates and had dinner at the big fancy house of the class president, also a dateless nerd. Then the limo the class president had hired got lost on the way to the dance and we didn't get there until midnight when it was all but over. To make up for it, I joined the competitive ballroom dance team at college, learned how to dance, and traveled all over the northeast going to dances and balls in fluffy gowns and full length gloves and sparkly shoes. Sadly, my husband has two left feet and we haven't gone dancing in 25 years. My date for the evening enlisted, served in Iraq, and became a high school teacher.

Watch the original ghostbusters, then watch almost anything besides the ghostbusters remake with either Kate McKinnon or Kristen Wiig, pretty much fucking great across the board. So the conspiracy is that the movie was designed to be bad to prevent further reboots as well as female lead remakes of movies that make no sense 30 years later. I don’t really buy this theory but a part of me wants to because it’s hard to think that amount of talented people could make something so shitty and release it",833
t3_nd9oh1,"ELI5: How does pirating movies, shows, video games etc. work, and why can't creators/producers prevent it from happening?",gy9jin4,"**Duplicating and Sharing:** It works by duplicating the content of the film, album, video game or anything else through the use of recording or ripping software that is used to create a near identical copy of the original content as compared to the original source. It may be someone in a theater recording the film with a camera or it may be someone ripping a dvd or cd containing the desired film, video game or music then uploading the content through a file hosting service or a peer-to-peer service that can host the file for others to download. There are already measures of security set in place upon shipping the final product in the form a various copyright protections, but just like anything else no idea is ever perfect or complete. There is usually always a way around it and it’s only a matter of time before the vulnerability is taken advantage of if its a newer form of protection that hasn’t already been exploited. **Using Pirated Content:** Depending on what you’re aiming to pirate there are also various ways to actually play or emulate the content. Ranging from the easiest being pirated music and movies using iTunes or other media players that are usually integrated into our cell phones or computers, to some of the more difficult being emulation of video games through software developed to mirror the experience of the video game by taking advantage of the hardware found on your computer, cell phone, video game console, or anything that is at some point capable of running the software with anywhere from acceptable to near flawless performance. **Using Official Hardware to Play Content:** In many instances you may actually be able to run the files of the game using the native hardware found on the console itself, which may or may not require you to actually jailbreak or hack the firmware using a software exploit or by actually tearing apart the hardware and modifying it in some way. In some cases both, for example if anyone can remember the earlier PlayStation Portable models requiring that you modify the circuit board found in the battery to create a “Pandora Battery” so that the PSP would boot in service mode instead of the official software, but also required that you jailbroke the software by using the service mode to run files from the memory stick and taking advantage of the exploit. There’s also occasionally ways to burn the disk image of the game to a DVD or CD and playing the game on the actual console it came from. This can be done in different ways, but it really depends. **Security:** Developers and their hardware architects are always pushing the envelope to enhance their security so that these things aren’t possible, but no idea will ever be perfect. You can update an iPhone’s software as many times as you’d like, but in the end there will usually be a way to jailbreak the phone if enough time passes and developers responsible for the jailbreaks are persistent enough to express interest. There are always investments made to safeguard the product even after final production. Certain ways that app developers prevent people from pirating their services is to actually incorporate server-side security so that even if the app itself is exploited you can’t bypass the server-side protection that delivers the data from the service or subscription. With paid software there may be serial keys that are either bypassed using key generators or cracked versions of the executable used to run the application on your computer. Streaming platforms have also adopted DRM protection to ensure the exclusivity of their content and to prevent the content from ever leaving the servers themselves even when downloaded to your phone using the service which is done by encrypting and splitting all the downloaded content into potentially thousands of files containing the data that is being used to provide the source content found in the app and all split files being without a file extension at all. All-in-all there is no way to completely protect any product. There are DMCA takedowns all the time, but it never completely removes the pirated copies of the content from the internet. There is always going to be another vendor.",4188

It'd be a lot of work to figure out the numbers for that situation given the variety of objects, unknown weight of JNPR and the speed, but as a rough benchmark I'd say 770mph (the sound barrier) is plausible for that feat. AFAIK Ruby is a bullet-timer. Most combatants in Remnant are able to dodge bullet fire, and Ruby is definitely highlighted for her speed. Her Semblance allows her to break down her (and people/objects she holds onto) physical form into (IIRC) massless matter, allowing for brief omni-directional travel at blistering speeds. Her only limit seems to be the strain it puts on her, meaning that while she can zip around the battlefield or carry her group through the Atlas Command Centre no issue, she can't be using it for extended periods of time to travel across the world or anything like it. It's possible that in her ""rose petal form"" she can't breathe (like Mirio Togata), making sense given the complexities of massless matter not being able to respirate until reforming. Its why she's able to use it effortlessly during most fights, but couldn't just Semblance her way up Beacon Tower from the base to confront Cinder ASAP. So TLDR speed somewhere between 770mph and 1800mph (Avg bullet speed, though bullet timing also depends on distance, path of the bullet and knowing to dodge, etc).",1450

Looking through old scanned issues of *Amazing* or whatever will give you an occasional gem, and a whole lot of crap. The really pulpy stuff also has some elements to recommend it: authors were not afraid to cross genre lines (see: swashbuckling adventure tales and weird witchy powers among the ruins of Old Mars), and if nothing else they also had a simple, unsophisticated exuberance that's almost impossible to recreate now.

It almost sounds like you want to want to write a poem, rather you just want to write a poem. Like you like the idea of writing a poem more than the writing. So start by examining your motivation. It's easy to make the mistake of thinking that your poetry Must Be Significant And Meaningful. That's rubbish. Write a poem about whatever you want. Next time you're tempted to tweet something, turn it into a four line poem or a haiku instead. Build that poetic discipline, exercise that poetic muscle. Read some of the modern poets like Brian Bilston, who will write a poem about catching a bus or talking to Siri. If they don't resonate, read other poets and work out what you want to say by finding poets who resonate with you. Once you know what you want to say, it will be easier to work out how (the poetic form).",1067

If he doesn’t stop, then cut ties. Heads-up, he most probably won’t stop at this point. But at least you got some practice on how to set boundaries for a next occasion.

t3_nf9ej4,"ELI5: Why can't single-use plastics just be mixed together, melted down, and used to make any other plastic products?",gyk98u0,"Firstly plastic is not all a single chemical. There are thousands of different chemicals which can all be described as plastic. They all have different properties and do not work well when mixed together. It is hard to sort plastic as well since while they have different properties these are not easy to distinguish. There are some expensive big robots which use a number of different techniques to sort plastics but these are not common as they can be quite expensive investments. Another huge problem with sorting plastic is that most single use plastic products are composed of multiple different types of plastic and even other materials. It is very hard to seperate these materials from each other to sort them individually. Just imagine a plastic bottle which have a different type of platic for its cap and then the label is made up of yet another type of plastic with a forth type of plastic used for the printing on the label. And then yet another material is used to glue the label onto the bottle. That makes it almost impossible to recycle the bottle. And it is not just different types of plastic but you see a lot of packages combining metal foil, plastic and paper to get the properties they want. And you do not want metal foil or paper in your plastic that you want to recycle. You might just bearly accept the color pigments that is in the plastic as it is. And then another issue is that some plastics can not actually be melted down and recycled. Their melting temperature is higher then their self-combustion temperature. So even if you put it in a vaccuum and heat it up you will just end up with charcoal instead of molten plastic. The way these plastic products are made in the first place is through chemical reactions for exapmple by mixing two compounts together which will harden into plastic or by heating up a compound, sumbiting it to UV radiation or just give it a nucleation point. Even those plastics that can be remelted will often degrade a bit every time you do this so recycled plastic have a worse quality then freshly made plastic.",2072

t3_nfkplj,ELI5:Could someone please explain the Barr Effect of binary star systems to me?,gymx9ff,"The [Barr Effect](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/605357?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) at it's most simple was Barr, an amateur astronomer, noted that the orbits of binary stars are biased in their orientation in relation to us, which was an unexpected finding. Scientists expected the orientation of orbits to be randomly distributed in relation to the earth, since the earth or even our solar system have no impact on these distant stars. Since then, additional studies ([example](http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/seri/Obs../0113//0000075.000.html)) have shown that the bias is only strongly seen when observing certain types of binary systems: ""close systems with gas-streaming"", which were easier for Barr to observe, leading to the initial conclusion that *all* binary star systems were like this. However, I was unable to find an understandable explanation for *why* the Barr Effect happens. It may still be observation bias (these are the easiest systems to observe). \--- the extra details --- There's a LOT of jargon needed to understand what the Barr effect is measuring, so I'll do my best. I think this wiki page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude\_of\_the\_ascending\_node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_of_the_ascending_node) has a decent image and descriptions of the jargon I cover. I think the picture is necessary. When we describe objects in space, we don't have a ""universal north"" so we used Earth as a point of reference. We took our own north and equator and extended it out to make a ""celestial north"" and ""[celestial equator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_equator)"". This include describing orbital plane of various far away stars, planets, etc. Two major descriptors are the difference in angle between the two planes ([angle of inclination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_of_the_periapsis)) and the orientation of the orbit ([longitude of the ascending node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_of_the_ascending_node)) in relation to our plane. So, if an object were to have *both* those angles at 90°, it would mean that (1) if we overlapped the orbit with ours, they are perpendicular and would make a + shape viewing from one side and (2) when we observe it from earth, the plane looks like a straight line, just like if you take a disc and look at it on its side. You can roughly think of the inclination as how far ""up"" the orbital plane is from parallel to us, and the longitude of the ascending node as how far ""rotated"" the plane is in relation to us. 0° (or 180°) rotated looks like a line; 90° (or 270°) rotated you see the full ellipse like a disc. Another piece of information used to describe an orbital plane is the shortest distance between the two objects during their orbit, such as two stars in a binary star system. The point along each orbit where the stars are closest to each other is called the ***periapsis*** (for binary stars in particular, called the [periastron](https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/p/Periastron)). We use yet another angle to describe the location of the periapsis in relation to the reference plane. The angle (the [argument of the periapsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_periapsis)) describes how far along the orbit the periapsis is in relation to where the reference planes intersect. So, sticking with the case where the other two angles are 90°, if the argument of periapsis is 90° and you stand in the center of the intersection of the planes *when the star is at it's periapsis*, then the star you're talking about would be directly above you. If the argument of periapsis is 0°, then it would be on the ground, exactly where the two plans intersect. ~~Finally, we have what's called the~~ [~~longitude of the periapsis~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_of_the_periapsis)~~, which is a ""compound angle"" (an angle found by combining two or more other angles). The longitude of the periapsis combines the~~ *~~argument~~* ~~of the periapsis (the angle to the point on the orbit when stars are closest) to the longitude of the ascending node (how far rotated the plane looks from where we are).~~ Edited for correctness: when referring to binary star systems, the the longitude of the periastron (periapsis but for stars specifically) typically refers to the argument of the periapsis, not the compound angle that I described. [This article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/605357?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) and [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_of_the_periapsis) agree. &gt;The longitude of periastron, ω, in the orbit of a spectroscopic binary is the angle, in the direction of motion, from the ascending node (Where the stare moves into the plane of the sky) to periastron (where the star is closes to the focus) for an elliptical orbit So! Back to the Barr Effect. After observing a lot of binary systems, it was discovered that this last angle, describing where the periastron is in relation to the celestial plane (in the direction of orbit) was most likely to be between 0 and 90 degrees. Since everything was defined with arbitrary reference to us, this was very unexpected.",5168
t3_ng19ax,ELI5: what is different in the brains of people with autism to that of those without autism?,gypp03c,"From what I have read, the brain functions “differently”. Certain parts of the brain are more active than others. There may even be certain chemicals that are more or less activated when compared to a brain without autism. That could explain why some people have very strong intellectual skills but lack social skills. The part of the brain that handles math problems, remember details, etc... could have a faster frequency speed &amp; lower amplitude measurements. And the opposite for the part of the brain that processes social skills. These are questions that researchers are still trying to explain. But since autism is a spectrum, the “levels of difference” can vary.

t3_ng34wq,Solipsism: How can we know for sure that anything exists outside of our own mind?,gyorwnl,"You can't *know* for sure either way. It is always possible to just explain anything away, because the end result of your every experience is by necessity just your perception of something as interpreted by your mind. That means that if truly knowing, with actual, factual, and complete certainty, is the requirement, you're shit out of luck. However, there are other questions that could be asked to undermine this base question from the beginning. Things like: Why does it matter? Consequences for our actions exist, whether in some definite reality or our own perception of reality. Your experience of these consequences is the same either way. Simply telling yourself, or believing, that some outcome ""Isn't real anyway"" is meaningless because it doesn't change your end experience. What's the point of it all? Whether you are a naturally evolved animal who's brain has reached a state of complexity as to allow self awareness, a god created person with a soul and free will, or some disembodied consciousness existing in null space, there has never been any true indication of *Purpose.* Purpose of existence, no matter what form that existence takes, must be determined by the individual. That is no different if you are an individual among billions, or the only real mind that exists. The good news is that the answer doesn't have to be some grand, sweeping philosophy, it just has to be good enough that you can live with it. Even more, it's okay to decide ""There really isn't a purpose or overarching plan... I just want to minimize suffering, both my own and others."" Does Empathy matter, if other people might not be real? If other people might not be real, their experience of suffering or joy is no more disassociated from you than if they are every bit as flesh and blood as you. If a person appears, by every sense or test or reason or logic, to be real, then I can see no reason why their suffering could somehow matter less than anyone else who ""Is Real."" There isn't any indication that their ""simulated experience"" is any less complete or compelling than your own, and so there is no indication that empathy would matter less for these ""imagined entities"" than for real flesh and blood people. Am *I* real? This is another one that just can't have an answer. ""I think, therefore I am"" is popularly known, but I think modern ideas have put some holes in that. We have machines that can appear to think, and whether or not they DO actually think comes down to how an individual defines thought. Ultimately there's no real way to differentiate between having a real, physical, living meat brain that processes sensory input to produce some performance output, versus a hyper advanced computer that simply simulates the processing of simulated sensory data to produce a functional result. Just like our base question, it is always possible to explain either answer away. So, how can we know for sure that anything exists outside of our own mind? Ultimately, you can't know for sure. You can't even know if your own mind truly exists, until you start to define what it *means* to exist. By the time you have narrowed that concept down to a useful point, the existence of other things tends to fall into the same classification as your own. &amp;#x200B; But don't take my word for it, I'm obviously not some grand philosopher or all-knowing galaxy brain.

From the mouth they pass down to the stomach, where a combination of acids, enzymes, and physical churning breaks the food down further, both chemically and physically.

From the small intestine the remaining unabsorbed and indigestible parts (fiber, seeds, etc), as well as the water enters the large intestine. The large intestine absorbs most of the water, passing it into the blood, and the remainder is passed out as feces. Meanwhile, your kidneys are filtering your blood to eliminate wastes produced by your cells and to maintain your blood at the right level of saltiness. As they filter, they excrete water filled with wastes and salt, which goes to the bladder for storage and is then excreted as urine.

Just because God is loving, all-knowing, and all-powerful, based on your assumption, why do they have a duty to manifest the truthfulness of their existence? Is this duty merely part of your assumption? If duty is part of your assumption, then your argument is flawed as you already assume the answer as part of your question. It would be the same as saying: 1. God is good and because he is good he would not send people to Hell 2. God sends people to Hell 3. Since God sends people to Hell, God is not good Whilst the logic is okay, your assumptions do resort to sophistry - they make sense logically, but not semantically. In my example, I am falling for the same flaw as you - I simply assume that a good God wouldn't send people to Hell, but this isn't clear why. I'm just playing around with the definition which is pretty much sophistry. For your argument to hold weight, you should make it clear why there is a direct link between ""loving, all-knowing, and all-powerful"" with this ""duty"" God has to manifesting himself to his diligent seekers.

Inside of it, I found various empty chewing gum wrappers, some coins, a rusty paperclip and then a note that said: ""drive safe on your trip. I love you and call me when you get gas"".

t3_nirfnp,How to not feel rushed to write?,gz3m4p1,"A ticking clock is the bane of every writer's existence. Okay, so one bane out of maybe dozens. But most of us feel those ticking seconds. Every.

My only suggestion (from personal experience): also allow yourself sufficient time to chill (guilt-free!) between those endless hours of writing. Because if you don't, if you push yourself too far, too fast, you're going to eventually strain your brain muscle and collapse in a cerebral heap and maybe you'll never want to write again. And, yeah, that's a thing. So this *is* the perfect time (as The Plague slowly diminishes) to write. But it's also a great time to sit and watch the world go by. (Which, btw, can lead to some really great writing.) Everything in moderation, I guess. But if you ever feel yourself getting *overwhelmed* by your writing—quick, run out the door and smell the roses. Or some other cliche.

t3_nirqih,"Eli5, how is it that when you pee, all the colour from what you’ve had to drink is taken away?",gz3hoam,"Because of what your body does to the drink, which is kinda complicated: Drinks are made up of a bunch of different chemicals. Some of those are useful to the body, so it keeps them. Some are harmful, so it gets rid of them in urine. Others don't ever go inside the body at all, they just remain in the digestive system. Let's follow a drink from your bottle to your toilet. You have a can of diet pepsi. In this diet pepsi are many different ingredients, but the ones we'll look at are water, carbon dioxide, aspartame, caffeine, sodium benzoate, and E150d. Water is the base of the drink, carbon dioxide is what makes it fizzy, aspartame is what makes it taste sweet, caffeine is what makes it addictive, sodium benzoate makes sure it's not too acidic and E150d gives it that coke colour. You take a drink, and the pepsi goes down your neck, into your stomach, and then into your small intestine. In your small intestine, water is absorbed into the blood stream, hydrating you. Carbon dioxide is absorbed into the blood too. Aspartame however degrades rapidly into three new chemicals: aspartate, phenylalanine and methanol. All three of those things are absorbed into the blood, but aspartame is so easily degraded in the small intestine that no aspartame survives long enough to be absorbed. Caffeine is absorbed too, as is sodium benzoate. E150d however isn't absorbed, because the cells of the small intestine don't have the ability to absorb it. The colour component of the pepsi remains in your digestive tract, and will continue on down that until excreted as faeces. Since that's already brown though, you obviously can't look at it and go ""oh yeah that's the colour of pepsi!"" Meanwhile, the elements of the pepsi that entered your blood are water, carbon dioxide, aspartate, phenylalanine, methanol, caffeine, and sodium benzoate. Of those, carbon dioxide, methanol, caffeine and sodium benzoate are all poisonous, so the body needs to get rid of them. Carbon dioxide is easily removed - the blood hands excess carbon dioxide to the lungs, which gets rid of it by breathing out. The liver gets rid of methanol by turning it into acetic acid, which can actually be used to generate energy in a similar way to sugar. Caffeine is slowly degraded into three less toxic molecules (which I'll just call dead-caffeine to avoid throwing even more fancy words into this), and sodium benzoate is turned into hippuric acid. So, finally, the body has to get rid of the three kinds of dead-caffeine and the hippuric acid. It does that through the kidneys: These bad chemicals are extracted from the bloodstream, diluted with a bit of water to prevent them solidifying as kidney stones, and sent to the bladder for later urination. So the end result is that of the six chemicals we tracked in the diet pepsi, only one of them actually made it all the way through the body into the bladder: the water. The others were tragically lost along the way - one became faeces, another was breathed out, and the rest were transformed into more useful and/or less toxic chemicals. Nothing of the original pepsi remains, so the colour of your urine is determined instead by the colours of these new chemicals, and of other poisons pulled out of your body by the liver.",3254

You can get a car that can do all of these things for $2500, or even less. You can also get thousands of upgrades, meaning your car could do waaaaaaay more things like “have working windows” “have more than 4 seats” “have an air conditioner” etc... and these will all drastically raise the price... because that stuff costs to produce/fix. Expensive cars are not only decked out in features, but are designed for efficiency and storage, and even looks. It’s the next level of car; it’s not just a thing with wheels, it’s a personalized and customizable mode of transportation. And maintenence- well you can actually maintain a few things yourself, if you spend enough time on your own reading and learning what to do. Most people don’t actually do this and will pay for a auto shop to fix. Real issues with the car (not scheduled maintenance) is quite expensive, but generally these are car-specific problems, and you need people confident in their work to be fixing those kinds of things",1190
t3_nishgk,What was the worst you’ve been rejected romantically?,gz3i7p8,"Since I asked I’ll also answer, this was when I was 15 and I had just moved to a new school. This school went from year 10 all the way to the end of a levels, which is year 13. One day at lunch, I saw this goth girl two years older than me, and for young hormonal naan lanan, it was love at first sight. So naturally this being my first ever romantic interest I wanted to lay an impression on her, so she would fall in love with me. Unfortunately, the only method I could think of, was to impress her with card tricks. I spent 2 months nearly, learning/creating lots of magic tricks and all these snazzy false cuts and shuffled I saw the magician dynamo do on TV. Not to toot my own horn, I became very very good at them. So the day finally came, I approached this goth girl who I had no chance with, while she was sitting with all of her friends and decided to preform. Naturally, I was nervous and my hands were sweaty and shaky, which lead to me failing everything I tried in front of her. At the end of it, her friends and her laughed at me and called me magic Steve for the rest of the year. Unfortunately my name is not Steve and my friends laugh at my attempts to this day a good 6-7 years later. One thing I learned from this is that my friends knew what I was doing was a bad idea and let me continue anyway 🤣 bastards.",1328

t3_njd7w2,Is it ever worth it to read older editions of philosophical works?,gz7d6u0,"It really depends! Different translations have different strengths and weaknesses. It also depends on the purpose of your reading. Some translations (like the Irwin of EN) are more accessible english than others that may be more faithful to the original Greek (like the Ross as a classic translation). How old a translation is may just mean some of the commentary or a word here and there will be a dated term (Burnyeat, for instance, is a pretty timeless translator but has a few things here and there that are funky.) On the whole, though, the year something was translated and published doesn’t really correspond to much else quality-wise. A lot of times you can look up translation reviews and places like Bryn Mawr Classics Review and others will have thorough write-ups comparing the different translations. In general, though, I think it’s fair to say that a big publisher will tend to put out a solid translation. Newer does not necessarily mean better.

t3_njfnte,Are there any theorists from the analytical tradition who you deem worthwhile for somebody versed and trained in the Continental MO?,gz8b2b8,"The analytic philosophers *de jour* among contys right now seem to be post-Sellarsians (Brandom, McDowell, Millikan - including Sellars himself), as a kind of effort to reinvigorate a kind of 'realism' that has seen to be lacking. That there's a rich engagement with Kant and Hegel there also seems to be the basis of alot of that interest too. There's also occasional interest in some post-Wittgenstinians - Stanley Cavell, Alice Cracy, Cora Diamond (including Wittgenstein himself) - which I personally find super productive. The points of engagement here tend to turn around ethics and politics more than ontology. I have a feeling this strain of things might gel better with your interests, but exactly how is something I can't answer. Edit: Also, the *locus classicus* of cross-tradition engagement has always been speech act theory - Austin and Derrida, along with Judith Butler, Shoshana Felman, and Paolo Virno. Cavell also dips his toes in on this too. For a general 'cross-tradition' comparative study, Lee Braver's *A Thing Of This World* is pretty great, although its axis of assessment is that of realism, which can be slightly jarring, though he makes an excellent case for it.",1191

They were never at home as they were building another home elsewhere and stayed there, so I was alone in the house. I had an exam the next morning and had set my alarm for like 5 a.m. to go over things beforehand. I'm a deep sleep so my alarm was set to a radio station on a very high volume. At 5 a.m. that alarm went off and my eyes sprang open. My bed was such that on my left side, I was starring at my door and the radio alarm was on the other side. My eyes spring open and I see this 'man' heading towards me and the bed, almost floating. I can see his long curly hair, his bell bottom jeans and wide buckle belt and long sleeved jersey shirt, but he has no face. And as he's getting closer, I'm flicking my toes and fingers and trying to assure myself that I'm actually awake, and as he get to the edge of my bed, he vanishes.

t3_njz9oy,ELI5: How should I recognize what time signatures are used in songs?,gza08n9,Firstly time signatures can be ambiguous. A lot of songs can be written in different time signatures and still be played the same. So guessing a time signature that is different from what the sheet music say does not necessarily mean you are wrong. When identifying the bars you should be listening for the first downbeat of the bar which is often emphasized. So you would count 4/4 as **1**\-2-3-4-**1**\-2-3-4-**1**. And this is usually audible in the music. It does not always sound as obvious as in for example waltz but after some practice you should hear this in most songs. And when you listen for this and also for any rhythmic repetitions you should be able to identify a bar and then just count how many beats there is in that bar. So if you hear something like **1**\-and-2-and-3-and-4-and-5-and-6-**1**\-and-2- ... you are dealing with a song in 11/8.,863

t3_nlaua5,What is the best (scientific or not) theory you came up with yourself?,gzhrd41,"Whippy Space. Whippy Space is a pocket dimension into which all minor items are attracted. Such as sunglasses, keys, TV remotes etc. If a Whippy nexus opens up such items are drawn in, which is why you lose your keys that you just put down a moment ago. The reason it's called Whippy Space is because it is controlled and used by Mr Whippy vans for interdimensional travel. If you recall a hot summer morning and you hear the tune of a Whippy van, you rush to grab your coins and run out into the street with the glorious expectation of a fabulous ice cream only to find..... nothing. The music you heard was the van engaging its Whippydrive, creating a nexus and dissappearing into Whippy Space dragging your keys and uncle Alfreds ornametal bottle opener with it. Whippy Space is also finite and slightly unstable (which is why you can lose stuff without the actual presence of a Whippy van) and operates on a FIFO principle. Once Whippy space is full it will start to eject items in the order in which they were accumulated, so if you want to find your keys the best option is to start losing other minor items until your keys are eventually ejected.",1153

t3_nl8jxy,ELI5: How does Flash memory work? How is data stored?,gzhli62,"Let’s start with a simple copper wire, a conductor: P _____ N If we apply a voltage from Positive end to the Negative end, then current flows. Next, let’s draw a semiconductor - a transistor: C ___ P_____N There is now a Control Gate on top. If we apply a voltage on the Control Gate, then the P to N path on the bottom is a conductor; but if we take away the voltage on the Control Gate, the P to N is an insulator. Last, let turn it into a Flash memory cell, by adding a floating gate in between the Control Gate and the P to N semiconductor path: C ___ __ &lt;— Floating Gate P_____N If we have charges trapped in the Floating Gate, then from the point of view of the P to N semiconductor, there is always a voltage at its control gate, thus it is always conducting; conversely, if there is no charge trapped in the Floating Gate, then whether P to N conducts depends on the control gate again. So there, you have the basic mechanism to read from a Flash memory cell: If it conducts despite no voltage on the Control Gate, then it has charge stored in the Cell. Multi-level Cells (MLC, TLC, etc) can further determine the amount of charge in the Gate by adjusting the voltage level of the Control Gate.",1205

Giga for 1,000,000,000 and tera for 1,000,000,000,000,000 was added in 1960 Computer memory is addressed binary so it is multiples of 2, not 10. 1024 is a multiple of 2 and people started to be called 1024 a kilo because it was very close in size The same way you get a * mega of 1024*1024=1,048,576* * *gigi 1024*1024*1024=1,073,741,824* * *tera 1024*1024*1024*1024=1,099,511,627,776 For giga the variant with 1024 is 7% larger than the 1000 variants The storage medium is sold with units using 1000 and it tends to be stated on the packaging and websites of the manufacturers Operating systems tend to use the 1024 definition.

t3_nm1jia,ELI5 What is most basic but irrefutable argument that the earth revolves around the sun and not vice versa?,gznat32,"Suppose you're on a spinning roundabout. Assume you won't get dizzy. You have a ball and you want to roll it forward in a straight line away from you, so you push it forward. However, you see the ball curve away from a straight line. You may initially think that's strange, because you just pushed the ball straight forward, yet there appeared to be something pulling it in one direction. You ask your friend, who is standing by the roundabout what she saw. She says that she saw the ball move in a straight line with respect to her. You want to know what's going on, so you start doing some physics. You see that, because you are rotating, there is some extra force that pulls the ball into a curve with respect to you. Now that you are inspired, you decide to see if you can calculate the path the ball will take, from your perspective. You note that you can perfectly well predict the curve of the ball if you take into account this extra force. You start discussing with your friend what is the best way to describe the motion of the ball: From her perspective, or from your perspective. You quickly agree that it's easier from her perspective, because from her point of view, the ball is just going straight, whereas from your perspective you have to do a lot of maths to find out what curve the ball is going to take. In the end you conclude: The ball goes in a straight line when viewed from someone standing still next to the roundabout. &amp;#x200B; Now to translate all this to the solar system. If we were to calculate the orbits of planets with the earth's perspective, we would get many extra forces pulling and pushing the other planets. We could in principle calculate the orbits from Newton's laws and they would look strange, as others have pointed out. The simpler approach is to say that we put a stationary point of reference at the centre of the sun and have a much easier time calculating the orbits. In physics (and I think in science in general) it's common to take the simplest model that does the job and so we say: ""The planets follow elliptical orbits when viewed from the sun as a stationary point of reference."", in the same way we said ""The ball goes in a straight line when viewed from someone standing still next to the roundabout."" There is a subtlety that I do want to point out: In this simple case, we assume that the sun is a stationary reference point. However, in reality, the sun also wobbles a bit. This would in fact complicate our approach a bit again, and we would need a different stationary reference point, around which the sun also orbits. But let's just call it a day for now.",2626

My (now ex) wife and I were camping in the Uinta mountains, we'd hiked a few hours in and were camped right off the trail because we'd gotten a late start and setup pretty much in the dark. So we're sitting around camp the next afternoon when this family comes walking by on the trail, a dad and mom and their daughter (probably 10). The little girl says to her parents ""We should ask them."" So the parents stop and ask if we've seen their son. And we've only seen one other person on the trail in hours, a man in his 30s. So we're like, ""Don't think so, how old is he?"" ""He's 6."" No, we definitely have not seen a six year old just wandering on the trail. So we tell them, and they are just completely unphased. ""It's fine, he's probably just up ahead."" We stress again that the only person we've seen in hours is 30 year old man. ""No it's fine."" And they keep walking. So we're obviously kinda freaked out, and about 15-20 minutes later we hear what sounds like a kid yelling from deep in the woods, way away from the trail in basically the opposite direction they went. So I grab a walky-talky and head off towards the sound while my wife stayed in camp. So way back in the trees, nowhere near a trail, I find a little boy just *wailing* for his mom. He's got a backpack, but it's unzipped and the only thing in it is a light sleeping bag that's about to fall out, and he's only go a light jacket. So I tell him I've seen his parents and convince him to come with me. I'm radioing back to my wife that I've found him, and she tells me she's got the family there. But that they didn't believe we'd found him and are about to keep going. Fortunately, they hear his voice through the radio and wait. So I get him back to camp, and his parents just tell him to get moving, don't acknowledge how freaked out he is or thank us. Only his sister has the decency to say thanks and seems happy to actually have him back. My wife was fuming and said after they left we should have taken him to the ranger station instead of giving him back to his parents. Which I kind of agree with. And I just hope the kid appreciates how lucky he is that the big bearded guy that found him in the woods actually had seen his parents and actually was trying to help.",2323

The music is wonderful, each area the music feels like it is tailor made for that area and evokes it’s mood real well. There’s also a ton of lore behind the game as well. It’s currently in early access on Steam, but don’t let that put you off, it’s better than quite a lot of polished, complete games on Steam. There are currently 5 completed, fleshed out biomes in the game, each with 1 boss that spawns exclusively in that biome. There plans to add further bosses and flesh out each of the unfinished areas currently in the game. Each world is randomly generated using a random seed, like Minecraft, but you can enter in your own seed if you want something specific (close bosses, far bosses, good starting island with resources or not). I’ve only played on a randomly generated seed and if you’re just starting out, that’s probably the best way to avoid spoilers. You can also just build shit and not worry about the story. The game’s building mechanics are pretty forgiving (if you destroy something you get back all of the materials used to build it) and you can build pretty amazing shit, if you’re willing to invest time to gather the resources required. It takes a bit of getting used to, but after that the sky is the limit. The best thing is how free you are to do what you want. I’ve heard of people playing 100 hours plus and not leaving the starting biome, just building up gigantic home bases. I’ve heard of people speed-running this game, trying to beat it as fast as possible.

Biscuits aren't difficult to make, and a batch of whole-wheat biscuits would last you all day and be better for you, but like most of us, you go with the easier option. A 19 year-old girl diesn't ask a 27 year-old man to clean the trash out of his car, get a job, talk nicer to her mother, or stop peeing in the sink, all things a woman cliser to his own age might request. She makes him feel like a big man just because he talks to her. You haven't had the time or the opportunity to mature enough to be his peer. He contacts you when his broken sense of manhoid needs a Band-aid. Source: been there",1303

Without using any factorizing tools tell me which two numbers I multiplied together to get that result. You likely won't be able to unless you go try every number one by one until you hit the right answer. However if I give you one of the numbers you can easily find the other. While not exactly the same the private/public keypair are a bit like that. The cryptographic properties we're interested in are arranged in such a way that the two operations: encrypting and decrypting, are really the same operation that just happen to cancel each other out. You can't use the public key to undo the public key because you need to go *the other way*. If you walk ten miles west walking a further ten miles west won't get you back to where you started. In order to undo the public key either you have to have the private key, or you have to guess billions of potential combinations until you hit something that happens to undo the public key. There is not easy way to find that number if you do not already know it, it's all about as hard as just guessing randomly.",1125

Not day trade gambles, invest as in ""I think this coin has long term potential"" place 100 dollars in it and leave there for at least one whole year before you ever consider selling. Investing in long term will end up being the safer and probably more profitable option when It comes to crypto.

t3_n2j0y5,ELi5 : Why Positive charges always are on the upper side of cloud and negative charges below it ?,gwjn6k9,"So a thunderstorm has two parts that form lightning, an updraft and a downdraft. These are massive columns or air moving up/down. When that much air is being moved around it is easy for dirt or sand or dust to be picked up and thrown into the storm as well. When bits of the particulates collide they start to build up a charge, this happens enough times and you can have such a large difference in charge between particles that you get lightning. Now for the question, positive charges are not always on the top actually. There are 3 types of lightning, cloud to cloud, cloud to ground, and ground to cloud. All of these decided by where the charges are. While cloud to ground is the one we tend to notice the most it is definitely not the only kind. Same thing with volcanoes as well, so much ash rubbing against each other that charges are formed and lightning goes off, however that tends to be in the smoke column so technically cloud to cloud lightning.",959

He ordered a junior dev to remove some crucial DB indexes which of course brought the system to it's knees on launch day. This junior dev confessed this to me , fearful and in secret. Our company had just been bought out too. This launch day was during a heavy snowstorm on a Friday and at around 4:45 he pokes his head in to the IT manager's office, who I was assisting in fixing the problem, and said ""you don't need me right? I'm off!"". The fix was obvious of course, SQL server was full of suggestions and alerts but the overly cautious IT guys delayed pushing out fix till around 9 PM, took forever to get home in the now blizzard. It was quite an embarrassent to the company and god only know who he blamed for it, likely me, luckily our marketing and support departments were on the ball. The irony is I had sent out an email specifically stating that these indexes were not to be messed with months prior to this to head of IT and that same junior dev who was coerced into doing the changes. A year later, me no longer being in the company, I heard he was ""promoted"" at a company function, and everyone was stupefied, no applause and a retiring former owner had to give a long speech as to why he was promoted.

t3_n2rrbg,Have you ever been falsely accused? How did it go?,gwlr486,"You gain a true understanding of how proving a negative is impossible. You realize that being accused isn't that much different than having done it. You are in a no win situation, people you used to believe were ""good, honest and diplomatic"" turn out to be the first to use moral judgement to feel superior. They earned that reputation by dogmatically curating public perception and shamelessly judging others under the context of innocence and moral superiority. The world is never quite the same, by your own behavior and how others treat you. There is no way to defend yourself or prove innocence that isn't judged. Seven years later when the Uncle who accused you of stealing Grandma's jewelry is grappling with dementia and his daughter posts her private pandemic wedding photos, being proven right doesn't even matter anymore. Did it ever? Not to me, he had the jewelry locked in a safe in a home he was living with his parents as a never employed 60 year old whose grifts ran dry. My twenty minute attendance at the home for the first time in years was not, could not, and should not have been so easily accepted as a criminally professional level heist. It was so dumb and shameless, to say nothing of how my lifestyle didn't change with this infusion of stolen loot. The accusing family on the other hand suddenly started traveling, paying off a family home, etc. Still, seeing my cousin wearing some of the jewelry I stole was vindication. Not like I expected though. Eventually the truth does always come out, but at that point it's hollow. I don't want a relationship with anyone who decided to accept his lies because it was easier politically and logistically in the family. The most satisfying moment was responding with a text that said ""I love your jewelry!"" Her immediate response was ""Thank you, it meant so much to have a part of Nana with me on my wedding day."" I almost felt the shift when she realized what she just said, like her ""oh fuck"" moment even hundreds of miles away. I decided it was the last time I would ever address it. I wanted everyone to see those messages and wonder? I didn't want to give them what they love, confirmation of their extreme curiosity. Did that mean what we think it did? Can't wait to watch this drama unfold. Nothing unfolded. They get that one confusing but very damning interaction, because at this point we all look worse for it, and I will not be the source of weaponized gossip fodder for other people's entertainment. Still, my experience teaches the harshest reality of untrue accusations, the true culprits emerged the victors.",2593
t3_n37xpa,Is it okay to block someone who gives you anxiety even if that person is a friend?,gwo2fbm,"I think it'd depend what the anxiety was about. If they're a friend, like the relationship is generally good, they're actually a friend, then I might think it worth talking to them about what they're doing that you're getting anxious about. Like trying to have some sort of talk there and work something out - because there's value in that relationship and just blocking someone's more or less like that someone's just died and dropped off the face of the earth. Which if someone genuinely cares about you and there's an investment in that relationship on both sides could be kind of a mean thing to do without trying to work anything out. But if they're just someone you know where you're just generally polite and that's what you're calling friendship, I don't think there's much wrong with just blocking them. I think it depends what the situation is.",854

He had a season pass so we were able to go in the park at 8 am as opposed to 9. The first thing we did was get in the line for the biggest coaster there the top thrill dragster. The line was normally 3-4 hours but we thought we were getting a steal having to only wait 2. So time goes we are looking at the front of the line now and suddenly it stops moving. The last ride we saw go off had a loud pop to go with it. After hearing this technicians knew something was up and shut the ride off. Me and my friend were determined to get on the ride but after 30 more minutes we knew we had to make a decision. We had to cut our losses and had to leave the line only 3 spots away from riding. Hindsight this was a very good decision since we walked by hours later in the day with the ride still broken down.

Movies and TV shows would get produced so that the image was a little bigger than what the viewer needed to see, with the idea that there was a border around the edge that was considered OK for TVs to crop out if they needed to. Digital displays (particularly if they include at least some analog inputs) kept the setting around because some people prefer to see things cropped the way they would have been on an older TV.

Essentially it was a combination of cheap/bad design and sabotage. The Trade Federation was notoriously cheap in making it’s droids, and it especially showed with the B1s. This was exacerbated by the fact that the design needed to be overhauled following the Battle of Naboo, which exposed the vulnerability of the loss of the command center causing a shutdown of the army. The B1 was redesigned to be able to operate autonomously, but between bad programming done on the cheap and hardware limitations they began to suffer from more frequent glitches. This was exacerbated by the Republic Intelligence service infecting many of the production lines with malware that while not serious enough to shut the droid down directly (and thereby tip off even the Separatists’ lax quality control) would cause the droids to have an increased tendency to quirkiness and bumbling.",1022

The lady lost it, started going off on this long winded karen type rant about how she was an English teacher back in New Jersey, and how they teach kids better there and don't interject fake words like 'yonder' into the language. She basically was going on about how uneducated and ignorant southerners were, when I just told her ""But soft, what light through yonder window breaks, tis the east and Juliet is the sun."" She asked me to repeat it, and I did, adding ""Yonder is an old english word, something that an english teacher most likely would know. It refers to a direction where the speaker does not know the cardinal direction, and the distance referenced is typically less than a mile. So, when Shakespeare has Romeo say ""Yonder window"", he's saying that Romeo doesn't know if it's the window to the North, South, East, or West; and it's within his view.

t3_n5wu6v,ELI5: How does Kanji have more than 1 pronunciation?,gx3u8aq,"Not learning Japanese, but have read up on it. Kanji (漢字), as its name suggests, isn't native to the Japanese (日) language, it's merely a borrowed script from China. When the script is borrowed, you can use it in a few ways: 1. Use the meaning of the character, and import it's meaning to Japanese. (semantic borrowing) 2. Use the sound of the character, and import the sound to Japanese. (Phonological borrowing) This results in (1) being used to represent words existing in native Japanese, (eg. 時 used to represent 'toki'; time) and (2) being used for new ideas (eg. 時代 'jidai'; era). This is a general rule, but not always true. From the above, there can be derived the two types of Kanji readings: Kun'yomi (meaning-reading; (1)) and on'yomi (sound-reading (2)). There is a complication from on'yomi; multiple times in history, the Japanese have travelled to China to obtain new knowledge, or for trade, and these form the backbone of multiple on'yomi readings: 1. Go-on (from the 5th Century Jin China) 2. Kan-on (from the 7th Century Tang China) 3. Tō-on (from the 10th Century Song China to 15th Century Ming China) During these periods, language in China has always been changing, and thus the sound borrowed also changes, despite the character remaining the same. Thus, there exists many different readings of a single Kanji character.",1345

We would try to see what was the strangest messages we could get the pager operators to type out. We played airport tag and ran through the airside without an issue. We were able to wait for arriving flights and play the dangerous game of saying ""Hi, Jack!"" to the group of arriving passengers. If we annoyed a security guard, we were just asked to leave and weren't arrested. To get rides home from our parents when we were out somewhere with our friends, we used collect calls to record ""momcomepickmeup"" in the part where you should say your name.

This is why the study of high level chemistry is split into organic and inorganic chemistry. Edit: Apparently organic molecules do not need to contain hydrogen.

t3_n7tj67,"What led to British philosophy being centered around ideas of practicality, empiricism and ""common sense"" ideas?",gxen95m,"Is this British philosophy, or is this a particular construction of British philosophy developed in a motivated way by deemphasizing cases that don't fit the view and emphasizing those that do? I mean, if British philosophy is the tradition of common sense empiricism, what do we make of Cambridge Platonism, which represents the clearest and most significant extension of Renaissance Platonism into the early modern period? What do we make of the school around John Norris, which represents the clearest and most significant continuation of Malebranche's program? What do we make of the culture around Coleridge, arguably the most influential Anglophone philosopher of his generation, and function as an Anglicizing gateway for continental ideas about idealism and romanticism? What do we make of British Idealism, arguably the dominant tradition in academic British philosophy for several generations, and a the most robust continuation of a broadly Hegelian program even after Hegel had lost his hold on the continent? Usually, these movements get presented as the losers in a process of historical development: Cambridge Platonism loses to Lockean empiricism, which then stands for us as the true spirit of British philosophy; British Hegelianism loses to Russell and Moore's logical atomism. But it's important to note that when we say things like this, we're not presenting a description of what philosophical ideas were most popular in Britain during most of the time, but rather presenting a motivated history according to which we take it that certain ideas -- though not necessarily most popular for most of the time -- count for us as the *right* ones. On top of this, the resulting construction of a supposedly integrated tradition of British empiricism suppresses what were in their time quite different phenomena. Philosophers like Hume, Butler, and Shaftesbury, now happily recruited as paragons of British empiricism, positioned themselves as critics of Lockean empiricism. Newton, who we're happy in retrospect to reinterpret in, say, Berkeleyan-Humean terms, was himself a rather more ambivalent figure and significantly indebted to, for instance, Cambridge Platonism -- and found, in his time, his most intimate spokesman in Samuel Clarke, an emphatically ""rationalist"" sounding philosopher with massive influence in his time, who is himself now often suppressed in folk histories of British philosophy for not fitting with the desired stereotype.",2466

t3_n7xzm2,Morally which of these options is best for bringing up your child?,gxfoca1,"If we take psychology concepts like modeling into account, then the pursuit of the former is likely to include the latter. However, the pursuit of the latter might very well be less likely to coincide with the former, and it may even impede itself. Kind of like a self-defying prophecy. If you raise them solely to benefit others, they will likely grow to resent the world as though the world is a parasitic environment that only demands utility out of them. However, if you see them as worth nurturing for their own benefit, then it is probably more likely they will see the world as an environment that is also worth nurturing. Basically, your more personable interactions will get through the message of altruism much more easily then some sort of rule-based altruism, or wholly selfless altruism. Kind of reminds me of Kant’s ideas on treating humans, not as tools, but as ends in and of themselves. Although it’s not the most universal of dictum’s, it definitely seems to ring true here.

t3_n8ds0j,"ELI5: In music production, what does it mean to ""widen the sound"" ?",gxiaycg,"To add to what said LeppidKing said: When a sound happens around you it hits each of your ears at slightly different times and with that info independently going into each ear your brain uses this to perceive the space and dimension of where's it coming from and how far away it is etc... As stated a mono sound coming out of two speakers is identical on both sides and the waveforms are identical and exactly ""in phase"" with each other so you perceive them to be in the center or ""phantom center"" since there is no actual 3rd speaker in the middle. By turning down the right side the sound will start to move to the left and vice versa which is what a pan knob does on a mixer. If you record in true stereo with two mics the distance they are from each other will create a feeling of varying degrees of width. If you use an XY pattern which is both mics very close together which mimics how your ears are arranged on your head the stereo width will be somewhat narrow. If you do an AB spaced pair with mics spread apart it will tend to sound wider. This really has to do with the phase relationships that differences in timing and distance of the mics create. Phase of course is a complex subject you can really go deep on! So if you have an element going in a production or mix that you want to ""widen"" technically what is usually happening is you are using some processing tool to manipulate after the fact a sound or recording. Usually by splitting it up into frequency bands where you are shifting phase relationships that intentionally put them more ""out of phase"" which creates a feeling of an artificial widening psychoacoustic effect. Something like a stereo imager from iZotope Ozone or the Waves S1 as an example. You can also add things like chorus/phaser (which are essentially just copies of the sound mixed with the original that are slightly out of time and pitch with it). And many other similar techniques as pitch differences can also create an artificial widening effect. Slight de-tuning copies of a sound will achieve this. One other much used effect in this category is the ""Haas Effect"". This is where if you have a mono sound you make a copy of it, pan one to the left and the other to the right. By adding very slight amounts of delay to one side (usually no more than 30-80 milliseconds) your brain perceives the sound as single stereo sound that is ""wider"" psychoacoustically at least rather than higher millisecond values which produce more of an echo/delay effect. One last thing I should mention is if you are producing/mixing/mastering and curious about these techniques be very careful to not overuse them and always check the mix in mono to make sure you're not making things get lost or clash with each other to point that you're actually hurting the sound. But they can be fantastic and powerful when used tastefully and subtly! Hope that is helpful and not TL:DR!",2900

t3_n8zqa5,ELI5: How are scientists able to tell how old a rock is?,gxlazkj,"There are already several very fine answers to this question so I want to address some issues that non-scientists sometimes have trouble with, The first is the idea of accuracy vs precision. Accuracy is the closeness to the correct answer, precision is a measure of the smallest unit that can be determined. It is thus possible to have a very precise answer that is absurdly inaccurate. Getting an accurate answer requires one set of conditions, getting a precise answer requires a different set. Both sets must be met to have a good answer. Another issue that comes up is the age of the rock vs the age of its constituent grains or minerals. In the case of volcanics getting an age date on the time of crystallization of some of the minerals is not the same as getting the time of eruption. And in sedimentary rocks there is the time of deposition of the grains, the time of solidification of the cementing minerals, the possibility that some of the cementing minerals may be at least partially dissolved and then new ones precipitated in the voids. All three will give different ‘ages’ for the rock. A third issue that affects sedimentary rocks is that of erosion, transportation, and redeposition. This one can be particularly tricky if one or a very few fossils are used to give a date. In a particular instance I encounterred a few years ago the law of superposition indicated one age but the included fossils indicated a much older (like about 100 my older) date. We resolved the issue by comparing the fossils in questionable bed to those in other beds and noting that the fossils in one were heavily eroded as would be expected in the stream deposited sands and pebbles of the younger formation while they were vey shap and well defined in the older formation from which they had been eroded and subsequently transported. Geochronology is a wondrous thing but it is neither the worthless joke some maintain nor the infallible ‘truth’ some non-geologists think it is when they read a tag on a specimen in a museum.",2021

What can be sent to them, and how can a person advocate for them?",gxm1ra1,"I have posted on this before as I did have an old friend in prison before. You actually have to be very careful in helping them as if you try to reach out to the administration they will harass your friend since they can't do anything to you as a civilian. So tread lightly, unfortunately. But they always appreciate letters and photos, it's one of the very few things to the outside they can have. Often times you might just be the only one in communication with them. I have also found that they may have a hard time replying back to you, so if you're allowed send stamps and blank envelopes so they can write back. Many times they have to pay for these things and if they have no money they can't reply. Like I said, though, just be careful if you try to reach to the higher ups, usually they don't like it so they'll take it out on your friend. I and my friend learned that lesson the hard way.",898

t3_n9mb21,"Zombie apocalypse, whatcha doing? What’s your plan?",gxoo6p9,"OK so I am fairly isolated in my house. I have a driveway, but can't be seen from the roads. I can see the roof of one neighbor. Property is largely defensible, although there are a few areas with easily accessible windows. I have lots of boards and tools in my basement so I can probably rig up some protection to keep them off my deck, and seal up a couple sticky windows. Nice thing about the pad is that there are mudrooms on entrances, and two doors between you and flesh eating zombies is better than one. I can pop a skylight and access the roof from my bedroom. The roof is entirely unavailable to zed although there is nowhere to go when you are up there and it is very steep, so you're basically hoping for helicopter rescue if it gets to that point. I should add a rope ladder to my bedroom closet in case of such an eventuality. Anyhoo as long as I don't get rushed, once the apocalypse dies down a bit and before the zed in the major city centers have dispersed, I'd probably be pretty ok for a while anyway. I only have a couple weeks worth of food in the house, but I mean who has a month on hand. Currently I have solar power but it becomes useless when the grid goes and IM not an electrician.

t3_nc5cs9,ELI5: What do mosquitoes contribute to the ecosystem?,gy32ct2,This is actually a big debate at the moment. They are of course one of the many different types of flying water insects and does therefore contribute to the food chain and do some pollination just like the other such insects. However we do not know of any unique contributions done by the mosquitos themselves. Especially if we only consider the species of mosquitos that are capable of spreading diseases. There have been a few experiments before where various kinds of pesticides have bean spread over large areas in order to cull the mosquito population and reduce the infection rates of mosquito carried pathogens. And we have not seen any major environmental impact from these that was not down to the pestecide itself. So it does not appear like removing mosquitos from the environment will hurt the ecosystem. However it is a very complex system which we do not fully understand. There is currently an experiment being carried out in Florida using genetically modified mosquitos that is able to make that species extinct. This project is controversial but is still being carried out.,1090

t3_nd337u,What is your creepy experience that turned out not to be so creepy in the end?,gy8bpvw,"Here's mine: when I was 12, we just moved into a new large flat on the 5th floor. The flat was so large that I was basically in my own part of the flat with my own living room and everything, while my parents were in their part of the flat. The flat was on the 5th (top) floor. We moved during the winter and everything was fine until the summer came. During summer nights, I suddenly started hearing weird squishy walking noises coming from the living room (next to my room), you know like when someone with rubber sandals who just got out of the water with wet feet is walking around. For the first few seconds I was unsure of what I’m hearing, but after trying to listen more closely, I concluded that I really do hear someone walking around in wet footwear. The noise didn’t last very long, maybe around a minute, but would occur several times during the night. This started to become a more or less regular thing, I could hear it during most of the nights. During the day I was mostly outside (yay summer holidays!), so I wasn’t sure if it happened during the day. I mean, I did spend some time in the apartment during the day, but I was there for mostly like an hour or so (speaking just about my part of the flat - for breakfast, lunch and dinner I was in my parents’ part), so I couldn’t be sure. For the first few nights when I heard it, I was completely mortified and just decided to lay still in bed. After a few times, I gathered enough courage to go to the living room to see who is there, but of course no one was there. However, the squishy walking noises were still present, but now they were coming from my room! I returned to my room and again no one was there, but now the noises could be heard from the living room again. That night was the first night that I locked the doors to my room as I tried to sleep imagining some invisible wet-feet monster having a stroll around my apartment. The next morning I asked mom if she could sleep in my room for several nights, hoping that she might have some ideas on what the sound could be. She told me that I must be imagining things, but agreed to sleep in my room (I went and slept on the couch in my parents’ part of the apartment) for a couple of days. Well, the next morning’s breakfast conversation was really interesting, since my mom told me that I’m not imagining things because she too has heard the exactly same sounds like I described. She told me she didn’t sleep good that night and that she doesn’t want to sleep in my room anymore; I was completely terrified since I was now sure something paranormal was going on. I asked my mom if I can sleep on the couch in their part of the apartment permanently and at night we locked the door leading from my part of the apartment to my parents’ part so that the wet-feet monster can’t get through to me. Dad told us we were crazy, but still didn’t want to go and check it by himself. So more or less I got used to avoiding my part of the flat at night and I accepted that I would be sleeping on my parents’ couch for as long as we live in that apartment. This went on for like a month or so. One day, I was in my part of the apartment and I was looking through the tilt-opened window, when I suddenly heard the sound again. Squish squish. Squish squish. But this time I could also see where the sound was coming from – there was an old man casually walking in front of the building in flip-flops. To my utter disbelief, however, the noise didn’t sound like it’s coming from outside at all – it sounded like it’s coming from my living room. However, each squish was perfectly aligned with each step the old man took. When he got out the hearing range, the sound stopped. So, what me and my mom thought were some paranormal monsters actually turned out just to be people walking normally in front of the building in flip-flops. We never heard it during the winter because people don’t wear flip-flops in winter and during the day mostly no one was in my part of the flat over summer. We never thought to look out the window because the noise sounded like it’s coming right from the next room. The sound could be heard because I kept all the windows (both in my room and in the living room) tilt-opened all the time during the summer, but to this day (around 15 years have passed) I still don’t understand what in the acoustic fuck makes that noise sound like it’s coming from the living room instead from the outside. I still hear it regularly during summer nights. When people walk around in sneakers or in winter boots their walking noise sounds like it’s coming from the outside like it’s supposed to be.",4624

t3_ndgqsu,Just because a different path doesn’t mean I should be treated completely different right?,gyaktxu,"Going to a JC is a perfectly respectable choice. No everyone wants to do should go to a 4 year uni. Your parents are being draconian. Start with a plan. Tell them what you want to do and give them a plan for your future until the end of JC. They might understand and meet you. If they are being inflexible, then you can counter and set up a timeline with them to become more independent. For example, negotiating a flat rate for rides and room based on your pay for a year and using that until you save enough for a car or cooler heads prevail. However, if your situation allows it, you might be able to live with friends (or threaten to). Another idea is to get your sister on your side to advocate for you.

t3_ndr6ab,Gotta hide an envelope in a room any ideas where?,gyc5um0,"Are you going to need to get at it frequently? If it's a finished memoir, a permanent hiding place under the floor or inside the wall could serve. If it's a work in progress you might want a compartment that's either concealed or secured. I used a three ring binder as a hiding place. The binder contained normal stuff, and I squirreled sensitive documents inside the vinyl covering. Over time, the cover got dinged up and I couldn't use it anymore, but it was very good while it lasted. A tube is a great place to conceal papers. If you have a bed frame or a handrail or an exposed electrical conduit (careful with that last one) you might be able to roll up the pages and poke them in there.",693
t3_nduplf,How would you have ended Game of Thrones Season 8?,gycqli0,"I would have ended it the same way but develop the story better. Season 8 was rushed, that was its main problem.

Move the first three episodes, the ones that dealt with the Night King, in season 7 thus making it a 10 episode season and conclude that season with the defeat of the Others. Then have 10 episodes for season 8 that deal strictly with Daenerys' final conquest and her evolution from heartbreak and grief to cruelty.",502

And it was especially tongue in cheek when my parents got to the point of having joint finances so it's not like it mattered lol. My dad's dollar was already my mom's dollar as well lol. Like, ""Hun, would you rub my back? I'll give ya a dollar"" or ""go out and get my oil change done for me, I'll give ya a dollar"" &amp;#x200B; Another one of my dad-isms that my family jokes about since as long as I can remember was my dad would see trash on the ground and go ""Free X, don't cost nuthin"" ""Free gum, don't cost nuthin"" ""Free dirty sock, don't cost nuthin""",897

t3_necvvo,: How do calculators find out the square root of a number?,gyfl6jp,"Depends on the calculator, but here’s one approach, illustrated for square root of 100 1. Make a first estimate (eg half it, your calculator might make a better guess though) = 50. 2. Add that guess to your target divided by that guess, and halve. So (50 + 100/50) / 2 = 26. That’s your next estimate. 3. Continue until the difference between succeeding estimates is small (again depends on your device). 50 -&gt; 26 -&gt; 14.9 -&gt; 10.8 -&gt; 10.03 so it’s getting there very quickly.

t3_neuskr,Why do you believe relationships don't last as long as they use to?,gyia6fz,"There are a number of compounding reasons. First, it's no longer socially unacceptable to get divorced. Even some people who consider themselves religiously devout are willing to get divorced nowadays. Second, there are way more options for romantic partners. It used to be the case that, due to very limited options for travel and communication, people tended to marry within their village/town/city. Since this is no longer the case, and since many people relocate to different cities or countries now, changing romantic partners is more common. Third, there exists in every culture a standard of beauty which most people, subconsciously or not, hold as the ideal within that culture, if not the world at large. If they feel their partner doesn't measure up, they're more likely to try looking elsewhere. While it has always been true that some people are more beautiful than others based on whatever criteria, in the past a person's beauty was less important in a relationship that what they provided in terms of income, dowry, lands and titles, etc.",1053

t3_nf9hsk,ELI5: How is Universal Income supposed to work?,gykbq80,"The idea is that everyone especially the richest people pay a bit more taxes and everyone gets a flat monthly income. For the poorest of the poor this is a net benefit, the richer people are the less they benefit from it. At some income level what you pay more in taxes equals what you get from the basic income and nothing changes for you. For the really rich high income the extra taxes far outweigh what the tiny monthly check they get. But it doesn't stop there. Because if people's basic needs are met they will be less willing to engage in shit jobs, wages for the lowest paying jobs will rise. This will trickle up to the ones with better paying jobs. (we are seeing some of that right now.) There is also the fact that the economy as a whole will grow. Poor people spend money. A rich guy will not spend all his monthly income. There will be savings and investments and other stuff. A poor person will rarely have money left over at the end of the month. By redistributing money from the rich to the poor you will put more money into the hands of people who by and large will immediately spend it on stuff. This creates demand and puts money more directly into the economy than investing in stocks or an account in panama would. Of course some special products will increase in price. anything where supply is inelastic but demand will rise if more people have a few dollars more in hand. This is not a whole lot. Almost anything with truly inelastic supply is already quite expensive. The one thing that is cheap and where you can't create more of it easily is labor. Labor cost for the lowest paid jobs will rise, but that is a feature not a bug.",1656

t3_nffusa,"What do you do to outline a story? If I stood next to you while you did it, what would I see?",gylaf8n,"Me having a hard time focusing because someone is standing next to me while I try and work. Though, if I were alone, I'd have a few different docs open (I just use google docs) and I make notes and write down ideas. Generally if I'm writing an outline, it is as a note, and I've already seen it in my head. I tend to fall on the three act structure as a framework, but don't adhere to it rigidly. So I'll write very basic sentences. &amp;#x200B; *--introduce main characters. (side-focus on the turmoil in their society)(main plot strongly implied)* *--mains are out casted, meet up. (then make a not for the idea or event in which they meet)* *--mains get to know each other, find where they differ, and where their goals align.* &amp;#x200B; Pretty much just notes like that. Though I'll often includes names and places and things specific to the story. Then I keep it open while I write, and use it to write down ideas I have for later in the book. These helps me keep writing where I'm at, comfortable that I've made the note and will not forget the idea later. I'll also fill in new bullet points for scenes I have just written, summing up the important aspects of them. So by the time my rough draft is done, so is my outline. Then I can use that outline with my rough draft for the second draft. Which for me, is mostly checking for continuity, and story flow. Making sure events that serve the same purpose aren't repeating themselves, and being able to reorganize the story as needed at a glance. My outlines start out very skeletal, then get fleshed out as I write. So, you'd be awkwardly standing next to me for weeks or months.",1639
t3_nfkfdb,How would universal basic income affect our society? Is it a potential solution?,gylz0a1,"Basically it would cause problems just the same, but worse, as we see with the stimulus checks. Rapid hyperinflation. Because you can't just print money with no value of production backing it. When you just print ""free money"" and give it out, it completely fucks up the economy. When you print billions or trillions of fiat currency, the value of all total currency goes down. If UBI was instituted, the problem is that every single company also sees this. Every company will just naturally say ""Prices just went way up! Don't worry folks, you can still afford it, use your free money!"" But the problem is that every company, every landlord, etc... Everyone raises prices. So the purchasing power of everyone actually will go down and Cost of Living outstrips UBI. The idea of UBI just doesn't make any logical financial sense. Not in our current economy that is based on human labor. The only way I see it working is in the future when we have robots and AI do all the work and labor and production. At that point, humans don't need to work or produce, so we can change our entire economy and value system to adjust for that....",1129
t3_nfol8g,What is bad about Socialism and Communism?,gymn5cd,"Depends on what you define as socialism and communism. Communism in its original definition is a classless, stateless, moneyless society where property is owned collectively and everyone does what he can and gets what he needs. In other words, there is no real downside to communism or it wouldn't be real communism. Socialism is basically a transition between capitalism and communism where a state has control over all the property, but is otherwise the same as communism. Both socialism and communism are democratic. The bad thing here is the existence of a state as a transition to communism . Other forms that have been called socialist or communist like china, ussr or north korea are usually autocratic and lack democracy. Also it is not classless as there is a party elite and they were all in only one state. Those systems are what unknowing people refer to as communism, and bad sides include famines, resource scarcity, lack of motivation and violations of human rights.",981

t3_ng9z0n,How to find balance between describing the setting/action and the thoughts in the MC's head?,gypqp5j,"Personally, I figure that the skulls of characters tend to be overrated: it's dark and wet in there, and the real action is happening outside. So you might consider that maybe you're doing it right and haven't noticed. When I write in third-person, I only report the viewpoint character's thoughts and sensations when doing so is more interesting than narrating the scene externally. This varies enormously from scene to scene Also, I realized a while back that powerful moments tend to take people out of themselves: their inner monolog grinds to a halt and they have a period of pure experience. They process what happened later, after things have calmed down. Trying to combine the two in the same scene gives a strange sense of dissociation, as if the character can't really focus on events because their thoughts are so much more interesting.",847

Why not Neutral or straight into Drive?,gyq1cpy,"You could probably add a N between P and R in newer cars that are all electronic but in older cars (back when the PRND standard was adopted) it was a mechanical linkage with the transmission and there could be only one N. So that means it would be PNRD or PNDR. PNRD is problematic from a safety standpoint because if your accelerator gets stuck while in D you want to be able to instantly shift to N so your engine may rev like hell but at least you won't be powering the drive wheels anymore. Likewise with PNDR if the same thing happened while backing up. (unlikely, but possible). So the best compromise is PRND so whether you are in R or D you can go to N instantly and disengage the engine from the drivetrain.",716
t3_ngbwia,What changes would you like to see in the gaming industry?,gyq05lv,"I hate the current trend of gaming, where companies are endlessly taking the mobile gaming model... More and more major studios are releasing unfinished games, as either ""Early Access"" or ""Beta"" or ""Games as a live service"". Some are releasing free games, others still charging full price for a broken game. Then they are locking content behind paywalls, adding battlepasses, adding loot boxes and other randomized gambling, adding ingame currency, etc. All of this to trick players into dumping more and more money into a subpar game.... It's really too bad. All the best games I've ever played are a single ""buy it and you own it, fully. No necessary microtransactions"" I don't mind paid DLC if they are legit expansions on an already long and awesome main game that was worth $60. I think this is a PERFECT compromise. Companies can get paid more for supporting the game and adding content, but players can choose to not partake. The problem here being that greedy companies are literally cutting content from the main game just to package as DLC. DLC should never feel like a necessary part of the main game. It should always be extra content, it should add stuff, but it shouldn't be critical to the narrative. Also, it seems like there is a longterm trend of major studios dropping story-driven games for multiplayer bullshit. This really pisses me off, because most multiplayer games have really shallow or shitty stories, and they are designed to be grinds. Fuck all that. I love my story driven games. The one company that I believe is still doing it right is Rockstar. Sure, they take a long time to release games, but all their games have insanely large single player games with awesome stories. Then they tack on an online element after to be the cash cow. And people can fully ignore the online entirely and still get their money's worth, and the online is just extra. Like GTA5 was well worth $60, it' was awesome. RDR2 is the GOAT of gaming, well worth it just for the story, and the online is just a bonus for those that want it. I just hope Rockstar continues this, instead of abandoning the single player games that made them famous for online only bullshit with shitty stories and nonsense. But so far, Rockstar has done the right thing, IMO.",2261

t3_nhleh2,"Quick question: If logic is normative, then are arguments normative also by extension?",gyx26ca,"Arguments are normative in the sense that, given you believe the premises and the argument form is good, you should believe the conclusion, or you have reasons to believe the conclusion (depending on the strength of the argument). You would be making a mistake not to believe the conclusion, etc. Or, conversely, the argument gives you reason to give up belief in one of the premises, etc. The argument can't and won't force you to revise your beliefs, but something is going wrong when you don't. These are all normative notions. They are all derived norms in that they are cases where you get more specific guidance from the application of a more general norm (like trying to remain consistent). That is, your upstream commitment to various epistemic norms have downstream effects in how you respond to various arguments.",823
t3_nhlk0g,how do salvage rights work in Aliens?,gywz5x0,"Believe it or not, they're probably operating under laws that exist for maritime ships *today*. The **Law of Salvage** is that if you recover a ship or cargo that's sunk, sinking, or otherwise in peril (well, obviously not if you're the one *causing* the peril), you're entitled to a reward to compensate you. The sum is to be determined by a later court hearing that will take into account the value of the cargo salvaged and the risk to the salvor. Discovering that Ripley was still in hibernation would have indicated to the salvage crew that it probably wasn't ""in peril"" (in reality, it arguably was) and therefore they probably weren't going to get any salvage money.",673
t3_nhlm6f,"People who have blacked out from drinking, what is the weirdest place you've ever woken up?",gyxckyg,"So this was about 4 years ago. I woke up in a startled panic, springing up the way that you can only do after a night of too much drinking, you know? It was in that moment when I first opened my eyes... that I realized I seemed to be floating midair. Looking down I see I’m in a bed made for humans half my size; I start to notice all the toys on the floor; on the walls are pictures of an adorable little boy I’ve never seen. I woke up in a child’s bunk bed. **A fucking child’s bunk bed.** A *stranger* child’s fucking bunk bed! Utterly bewildered, half wanting to laugh &amp; half panicking that I could very well be the worst human on the planet, I kind of rolled/fell off the top bunk and bravely ventured down the hall, before I started to remember... my cousin and I came back to this guy’s house that she clicked with at the bar the night before. He was recently divorced so he didn’t have the kids that weekend (well except for us, arguably). The only thing that was better than what I saw when I first woke up was my cousin’s experience. She opened her eyes to a giant portrait hanging on his entire wall, directly across from his bed, of his two young kids. Staring right back at her, judging eyes and all. 😂 It was a lot for two twenty-somethings to take in first thing in the morning with a pounding headache. I wish I could say we’re less deplorable humans now, but I’d just say we’ve gotten a lot better at screening our late night decisions. :) clearly not too good though otherwise I wouldn’t be posting embarrassing stories on Reddit at 3AM!",1559

He joined our Discord and we played a couple games before he just suddenly vanished mid-game. He was gone from Discord too so we figured maybe his internet went out. A couple days later, he messages me on LoL and apologizes for leaving. Then he says that he had to leave because his girlfriend heard female voices on his headset and made him get off, now she was making him block me. We hadn't even messaged before, let alone spoke since we last played. Which meant that it had been days, but she was still asshurt over it. I was super weirded out. We didn't cross any lines, make any inappropriate comments and he didn't even ask any kind of questions that remotely indicated that we were interested in getting to know each other what so ever.

I think it's up to interpretation on how the Joker felt about his ""defeat""/capturing at the hands of Batman. Continuing that thought, I think either he found it funny and respected it or was devestated, because Batman once again showed the world that he is incorruptable and that there are still good people left in Gotham.

I'm a little bit different of a person than I was 10 years ago, but I'd like to think it was for the better because I have a lot more personal experience to go off of. ""Wisdom comes with age"". I'm cognesant of the fact that we tend to latch onto mindsets that make us feel comfortable, but I also can recognize that things change over time. That being said, there are some feelings that I had 10 years ago that still ring true, especially with the new experiences that I've had. Some things just stay solid.

The parent or parents teaching their young, sheltering them, raising them. Future generations benefit from the things past generations have learnt. Anything else seems wrong and horrifying - because we are literally wired up in our brains to clump together and protect and teach the young and helpless. It’s who we are. But to an octopus, fathers are rather less important. They don’t have the same development trajectory that humans (or other mammals) do. An octopus baby will be just fine once it’s hatched out and eaten its mother. It doesn’t need a parent to teach it. Not like mammals do.",811
t3_niz5l8,What was the scariest experience you've had that might have defied all logic?,gz4k2na,"For me it was when I was a kid. My dad's uncle was a sheep herder who lived in a rural village where people were mostly farmers. We used to visit them sometimes. It was dinner time, so I went to the backyard to wash my hands. The uncle had a large pen where he kept the sheep inside. The whole thing was covered up by a roof and wooden walls except for a window next to the door. As I sat there rinsing my hands I felt strange so naturally I started scanning the perimeter. I glanced at the wooden window, it was dimly lit from the reflection of the backyard's only light bulb but it was enough for me to make out the silhouette of a furry horned being that was staring at me. I ran inside as fast as possible. Fast-forward to 6am when the uncle took out the sheep for grazing. I hadn't slept much that night so I looked out the window, expecting to spot a ram or a goat coming out. But none of the sheep had horns, and no sheep would be tall enough to look through that window. I was only 8 but I can still picture those two eyes staring at me.",1045

t3_nk51cb,ELI5: How do they digitally remove an actor from a film that's already shot?,gzb2kb4,"So the term you’re probably looking for is image inpainting. Basically, it’s easy to cut an actor out of a frame and paste a new actor in, but there are a couple pixels missing. We have a couple different ways of filling in the gaps. 1. We can use a statistical model to guess at the color of each missing pixel from the surrounding pixels in this frame and the pixels from the surrounding frames. This’ll end up kind of blurry, but we mostly don’t notice it. 2. We can use 3D models of the background and other actors. A 3D artist creates a model of whatever they think was behind the original actor and uses that to render the missing pixels. This approach is a lot of work for short scenes but might pay off over lots of frames. 3. We can tweak pixels by hand. This approach is difficult and time consuming for your effects artists, but it’ll get things right eventually. The part that’s crazy to think about is just how much work goes into each second of a professional film. There’s no magic technology answer, people just do a lot of work and spend a lot of money to make each moment perfect. I’m an image processing person, but not a film editor or CGI expert, let me know if I’m totally wrong here.",1206

t3_nkvsqq,Do philosophers take Pascal’s Wager seriously?,gzf4jnl,"It's an interesting thought exercise, but I'd say that for the most part, Pascal's Wager isn't really taken seriously. Looking at the solutions offered by Amanda Askell in this blog post, at least half of the challenges she responds to aren't particularly strong arguments to begin with. For example, point 3: &gt;Pascal’s wager assumes key features of the god it seeks to prove the existence of. For example, that god rewards belief and not non-belief. Isn't really an argument against Pascal's Wager that you'd commonly hear since the very point of Pascal's Wager is that one doesn't need to assume anything about the God you decide to 'back'. The point is that whether or not God would be responsive to such a Wager, it still makes sense to pledge to a God because it makes your chances of eternal paradise *something* rather than *nothing*. There are lots of examples of straw men arguments in this post but for me, the closest thing to a robust argument is point 11: &gt;But we don’t have voluntary control over our beliefs! Tellingly, she doesn't really engage with this question, she simply asks if the reader really believe this. But it's an important point; can I make myself actually genuinely *believe* something just because it's beneficial for me? Intuitively no. Might be motivate me to find reasons to hold such a belief? Yes, perhaps, but the crucial point is that the source of the belief is not just the wager itself.",1435

So the light from outside that bounces off the solid parts of the mesh is brighter than the light from inside the car that makes it out through the holes. So, for people outside the car, their eyes focus on the brighter light that reflects off the solid parts of the mesh and they just see it as a solid surface. Inside the car the opposite happens. The dim light from inside your car that bounces off the solid parts of the mesh is dimmer than the light from outside that makes it through the holes.

t3_nm486n,how can you tell the difference between anxiety/worry and actual intuition?,gzmhbw2,"I've actually observed a direct correlation with personality theory. Of course it goes deeper than that and is more complex, but there is a correlation nonetheless at least with Myers-Briggs typology. Intuition, at least from this context, is reading between the lines, connecting the dots, using trans-contextual thinking, and thinking ahead as to what might be. Please keep in mind that this definition may not exactly be what you're referring to, and I'm just talking about my observations in a very specific theory. From my experience it all stems around the perspective of the words ""what if?"" The phrase can mean what if something bad is going to happen that I cannot foresee, or what if the possibilities? People who worry more than dream, will often default to the first, and vice versa. This observation is most easily seen and people who use Si (Introverted Sensing: Detail oriented, good memory, in-tune with the present moment and the past) versus people who use Ne (Extraverted Intuition: Big-picture oriented, novel ideas, in-tune with the future possibilities and abstract thought). Si personalities include ESFJ, ISFJ, ESTJ, and ISTJ. Ne personalities include ENTP, INTP, ENFP, and INFP (It should be noted that in this theory there are two types of intuition, and I am only talking about one since there is a stronger connection to the topic and this type of intuition is also the opposite of Si, whereas the other isn't exactly opposite. If you'd like further details, ask in a comment, as it goes beyond the purpose of this post) Again, anyone, not just these personalities, can have anxiety or use intuition. This is just a correlation I've noticed on the topic within certain personality types.",1715

For example, when you double-click an image file, the operating system looks up ""Who opens .jpg files? Oh...it's this Photos app."" In order for that to work, the Photos app had to tell the OS that it exists, what kinds of files it can handle, and how to ""talk"" to it. For most large software, the software is also using a lot of shared resources (both hardware and software) on the computer. Part of the installation process is the program figuring out what and where those shared resources are, installing any that are missing, and generally figuring out ""where stuff is"".

t3_nmq2va,"From a Marxist lens, is colonization acceptable if it's spreading communism?",gzqczpd,"This was a hotly debated topic during the period of 'actually existing socialism'. As with most things in the history of Marxist thought, it's really (almost needlessly!) complicated. Some people, like Lenin and Luxembourg, both believed in colonisation of a sort (the definition you give also covers what they meant by the spread of communism). However, Lenin believed that after communism had been spread to another country, the people of that country should be afforded the right to self-determination, and should be able to decide whether to remain a part of the USSR or to abandon communism altogether. Luxembourg however believed that reactionary elements would always cause the abandonment of communism in post-capitalist societies unless it was enforced for a period. Two different perspectives on 'colonization', both very different. On the other hand, we might consider Stalin's 'socialism in one country' which prioritised establishing a socialist base above propagating it to other countries. The strongly anticolonial element in Marxist thought, if my historiography is accurate here (although it might very well not be, and if not I appreciate correction) arises mostly in the context of Maoism and the spread of communism outside of the (geographical) eastern bloc, for instance into Vietnam and Upper Volta. I think that anticolonialism has a strong affinity with Marxist thought. But it sounds to me like you're also asking about the question of national struggles for liberation, which is still a hot topic today. Should Marxists support the struggles for liberation of countries like Palestine, given that Marxism is strictly speaking internationalist and opposed to all states? I've spoken to comrades about this, and people fall on both sides of the question for many good reasons.",1802

t3_nnifu8,eli5 To what extent are brains like computers?,gzv1v45,"Computers generate heat because they work by way of electrons flowing through metal constantly. Since there is always some resistance, you get heat. Neurons don't work anything like that. They transmit information by way of electrochemical potentials where a polarized membrane depolarizes and a wave of depolarization travels down an axon and at the synapse, little molecules physically eject from one terminal and bond with the other. None of this generates significant heat. Cooling is also not a problem because the brain's power comes from massive parallel processing with enormous numbers of connections between units instead of computers which still largely rely fewer processing units that can process many millions of times a second. You can probably never do a thing like play a video game on a brain simply because it does not have the sort of features you'd need for that... plus the neurons are busy doing things like keeping you alive. How are they alike? Both brains and computers are kinds of information processors. This is a big deal because not so long ago, nobody really had the first clue how a kilo of grey goo could do things like reason or think. The advent of machines answered this question for us. Once you have a machine that can take some sort of input, modify it according to a rule, and spit out the result... you can (theoretically) put together some number of these that can do any kind of calculation or any kind of thinking. Thinking is information processing. This is also why many believe you could replicate every important feature of a human brain in some other form, silicon or some future hardware device... because info processing is info processing.

t3_nnyvg3,ELI5: How are microchips programmed to know what is a 1 and 0? Is it created with a hardwired coding language built-in from the very beginning?,gzzpj2j,"How a processor works I think it's outside of an ELI5. But I'll try to explain the underlying concepts. Remember the basic math operations: addition, substraction, multiplication, division? Well, there's a part of maths that deal with another kind of calculations: logic, that uses concepts like ""true"" or ""false"" instead of numbers. George Boole developed a way of calculating things using logic, what is now called Boolean algebra or Boolean logic, defining some basic operations called ""logic gates"" based on logic concepts, usually using 1 and 0 to represent true and false respectively. Let's use the idea of a conjunction: given two premises, both have to be true for the conclution to be true. For instance, if you want to hire someone to do maintenance work in a lot of places, you would ask for someone with the expertise *and* to have a driver's licence, you don't want someone with only one of those traits. In Boolean logic, there's a logic gate called AND that's used in the same vein: it has two inputs, and one output that will only give a 1 if both inputs are a 1, but if not, it will give a 0. Other logic gates, generally transforming two inputs in one output, are OR (the output is 1 if either input is 1), NOT (there's only one imput, and the gate inverts its value), XOR (""exclusive or"", it's the same as the OR but if both inputs are 1, then the output is 0)... If you combine them in certain ways, you can create more complex circuits, such as an adder (a basic calculator that adds binary numbers together). A processor is a combination of those kind of circuits.",1587

Then the next time he suggested hooking up, *I* was drunk and didn’t want to do anything silly. Then we were finally both sober, and it was kinda fun so we kept hooking up. Just, you know, for fun. A few months later he had a conversation with his housemate that went something like this: “Is your girlfriend staying over tonight?” “Huh? Oh, no we’re just friends who hook up.” “Uh huh. She’s got her own towel and toothbrush in the bathroom though, right?” “Yes?” “And she’s stayed over like five nights a week every month since I moved in?” “Yes.” “And she went out to dinner with you and your mum when she was in town?” “Yes.” “Mate, that’s your girlfriend.

t3_noi2ax,ELI5: how do successful restaurants run?,h00pjpp,"General operation of restaurants When your order is taken it's put into a computer which has software that breaks that order down into component parts. The kitchen is broken down into ""stations"". The exact delineation of the stations (how many, what they are responsible for, etc) depends on the cuisine, restaurant size, etc, but as an example you might have: a fry station, grill, saute, someone assembling salads and deserts. These stations may be staffed by one or more people. Each station has a defined set of responsibilities that make up the whole of a dinner. So when you order that aged prime new york strip with asparagus and a béarnaise sauce and crispy pomme frites, it gets broken down into multiple tickets, each routed to the specific ""station"" that needs to cook it. The grill station knows they need to grab a new york strip and cook it medium rare, the sauté (usually the guy in charge of the kitchen that night) knows to broil some asparagus and plate it with béarnaise sauce, and the fry station knows to drop the fries in the fryer. The real key is timing this all out, sophisticated kitchen software can help with this, but even with paper tickets a good chef can articulate the timing and a well practiced team knows it anyways. The order comes in at 8:24pm, grill knows the steaks are done in 11 minutes, asparagus done in 12 minutes, and fries done in about 15 minutes (béarnaise is probably already done and just waiting to be sauced). So the fries are going in immediately, but saute and the grill might wait a couple of minutes to time it closer. As elements get done they are often passed to the expeditor or expedite line. It's basically a station, often with the primary serving dishes and garnishes, where the various independent elements from the multiple stations are combined on a plate in a pleasing manner. The person filling this role can be a variety of people (including someone working at another station like the saute chef in smaller kitchens) but the point is, there is usually one person who assembles all the elements together, does a final quality check, and makes it look nice before a waiter takes it (think Gordon Ramsay in Hell's Kitchen). As you can imagine, in order to efficiently operationalize a kitchen you have to be thoughtful of the ""how"" it gets made. The example above involves 3 different stations and the food comes out pretty close to each other. The most labor intensive part is probably the béarnaise but, as noted, that can be made before kitchen service begins and just sits warm for the night. For things that take a long time to cook, there are often tricks you can use to kind of ""stage"" the food until later before opening for service. For instance baked potatoes can largely just sit in a warmer in tinfoil waiting to be used, Standing Rib Roast you can cook below rare and then just slice a serving off and quickly ""warm"" it to the desired level of doneness, in-house pastries and bread goods are made that morning (the pastry chef is often walking out, done for the day, around when everyone else is just showing up to work). You don't want to overprep but with history (and again, ordering software can help with this) you can get a pretty good idea of how many baked potatoes you go through in an average Friday night and plan accordingly. If it's unusually busy at 7:30 you might try to prep a few extra incase you get walk-ins at 9:30 and you think you might be low, but in some cases restaurants just accept running out (if it's that late). Pricing is easy. If you do a good job designing the menu and train your kitchen staff competently, you know exactly how much our example meal costs. There's some variance in portioning (it's possible to get more or less asparagus or béarnaise sauce) but keep in mind these people cook this meal over and over and over. If you can retain staff they get practiced enough that portions and cooking gets consistent as well. As a result you can keep food waste usually pretty small. Some items are more sensitive than most, frozen fries aren't going to be wasted, but fish isn't going to last very long. For nice restaurants using fresh ingredients you'll frequently see specials, stripped down menus, and changing menus to accommodate for that. Too much asparagus? Well it's not just a side dish anymore, let's maybe do an asparagus tips salad (and cut off the now woody ends), that'll at least trim our potential food waste down. Ordered some bluefin tuna? You'd rather run out by Sunday night service than have some left Monday morning. For less nice restaurants (think franchises) they're going to lean away from fresh ingredients at risk of spoiling. Glancing quickly at TGIF's menu, their seafood consists of fried cod filets, various forms of shrimp, and two salmon dishes (one heavily sauced) that I'm almost positive come to the store frozen. That's how those chain restaurants get away with such sprawling menus, it's all designed to not be sensitive to spoiling and having to be tossed (heavily saucing things is a way to hide this. Lots of sauces/glazes promote a restaurant feel because home cooks don't want to fuss with the effort while simultaneously doing a good job of covering up mediocre proteins that are frozen so you can keep food costs and waste down).",5294

At night, they also aired the next day's episode at 12:30 am, and I think the Cartoon Network ratings moderators caught onto that their ratings were starting to peak at this time, and realized kids/teens were watching in the early morning hours, in this case, just to see ""The Next Episode of Dragon Ball Z!"" so they introduced The Midnight Run starting around midnight of Toonami Shows from earilier in the daytime. Eventually, they changed it into Adult Swim and started airing more mature shows, like Cowboy Bebop, Space Ghost: Coast to Coast, Sealab 2021, Aqua Team Hunger Force, etc., and eventually got the rights to show reruns of the, at-the-time-cancelled Family Guy. The ratings I believe began to peak when it was on, and not too long after, the show was revived on Fox. There was even a short 'thank-you' animation short that aired on Cartoon Network from Peter about getting this show revived. I don't know if this is fact, but all-in-all, it's how I remember it, so whenever I see DBZ, I always think how it helped get Family Guy back on the airwaves in a strange butterfly effect, sort of way.",1448

Really try to imagine the flavours and the consistency of it. Do so for a minute. Now, if you did that, what happened? Did you perhaps feel how you had a reaction to the food? Feel the saliva in your mouth? If you imagined the food that is likely what happened. You had a bodily reaction to the mere thought of food. Same goes for anything. Yet there is no food, because thoughts are not facts and they don't reflect reality. The same is true about what you worry about. Because of low self-esteem you have this thought, but it doesn't actually correspond to reality. But you can feel the rejection and the uncertainty by the mere thought of them *not really liking you*. So you probably have to work on building up your low self-esteem. But apart from that, and until you've worked through whatever is causing your low self-esteem, try alternative thoughts whenever these thoughts of ""they don't like me"" appear. I am not telling you to just be positive instead, because if you're like most people you can't be positive all the time. Instead, remember thoughts are not = reality. So when these thoughts appear, try to shift your thought from ""they don't like me"" to ""I have a thought that they don't like me"". Then recognise that as all it is :) Good luck :)",1549

t3_n3bad1,"For those who succeded with losing weight, how did you do it?",gwoshv1,"Good rule of thumb if you eat sorta healthy and just need to get active to drop the weight; Cardio drops body fat levels, lifting weights builds muscles, strength training like areobics or boxing is a mix in between. You can drop pounds from just focusing on cardio, but you have to do a lot more of it to compensate for not doing anything else. I work at Amazon and I'm able to track my steps from my phone, it's not super accurate but the rough estimate is nice. Slow days I walk 5mi, busy days I walk 10mi. Every slow day let's me burn about 0.5lb. Every busy day I burn 1lb. Every day you walk/run/bike/elliptical, for that similar amount of distance you can burn about a pound. You can even split up those 5-10mil into those 4 workouts so your bones and joints don't get all tensed up. Half of whatever you burn will be water, there's no way around it. Half will be fat. If you go every day consecutively and give those amounts of efforts, you can drop 10-20 pounds in 20 days straight. Even when people say that you burn less fat when you get slimmer, which is true, in which you may feel as if you're hitting a plateau, you're still able to lose weight from all of that motion. I'm not too familiar with weight training because when I was in boxing I only focused on cardio and technique, but hopefully this can help.",1324

Spinoza basically just decided then that everything is one Substance, literally everything in the world is one, and that the things we experience are different modes and attributes of the one Substance. A development of Spinoza is the philosopher Deleuze, who tries to answer another question you put fourth: how can it be things are both seperate and one at the same time? How do we make sense of the unity of the world and the various differences that obviously exist in it? You also speak to the question of qualia which basically is the undescribable aspect of experience. Spinoza's Ethics and Deleuze's Difference and Repetition are books you might be interested in. You asked alot of questions and raised many interesting points that many people have spent their whole lives trying to answer, and I can't answer them for you or correctly, but hopefully directing you towards Spinoza as starting point and bringing up the question of qualia is helpful If these questions really trouble you these key terms might be useful to helping you find some answers on your own",1266

You can control your shifting to rev up bit beyond what automatic will allow.

They tend to be cheaper to replace overall, though clutch is considered wear item and will need to be replaced depending on your driving habits. They sometime discourage thiefs too. Biggest downsides are giving the car to friend or to be moved can be a problem (or benefit?). Stopping or starting on a hill can be annoying and stressful (when starting/learning). The car will roll back and require you to take your foot of brake and use the clutch+gas to move forward which is risky if car is behind you. Worst case you give it lot gas and let out the clutch (may accelerate quite fast). If you screw it up worst case the car will stall and roll back and you will quickly need to press the brake, restart the engine and try again. You will learn how to use clutch and it is not huge deal, though tailgating cars on steep hills can be incredibly annoying and require you to give a lot of gas to prevent rolling back. Last common issues is clutch can be make you foot tired, especially on (varied speed) long drives or in stop and go traffic. Manuals are not ideal cars for long commutes with traffic.

I drink water so much more than I used to. And feel so much better for it. Everywhere I go water has a slightly different flavor. Most bottled waters taste the same though. Those are much more bland.

One of them was able to escape, i believe hid behind the washing machine and found his moment. The other sibling was running down the road was chased down into a wooded area. The stories that were going around were absolutely fucking horrific. My friends and I never really knew anything of the family, but one of my friends lived somewhat nearby and knew where the house was. One night we decided to walk to the house (which had been abandoned for some time after the incident). This was in the height of our naive interest in Ghost adventures. We walked down that same road and stood behind the house for about a half hour seeing if anything would happen. Just knowing we where at the spot gave me horrible vibes, which is probably half of the experience anyways. We heard some rustling in the woods behind their house (an animal), and my friends tried to hype up the spookiness like something was happening. Regardless, the details of the event and being in the same spot were enough to keep me from wanting to do something similar again.

t3_n74n52,"National/state guard or reserve members, what’s your experience been like? How’s basic? How’s the training?",gxazxhv,"Not at all what the recruiter made it sound like. I’m a medic and spent the first 9 years attached to an Engineer unit with one deployment. I spend most drills on my phone, reading or finding a nice place to nap. I spent nine months in the desert. Nothing exciting happened. My unit wasn’t even deployed as engineers, they were security forces for a base. They stared at sand. I sat in a clinic and did sick call. I’ve been to a lot of cool schools - Mountain Warfare is a blast if you like mountaineering. JRTC was a nightmare with wild horses and no showers. Basic was underwhelming, it was more about being tired and shutting up than anything else. Don’t get me wrong, I love my people and training can be fun, but the day to day involves a lot of incompetent leadership, boredom and short bursts of chaos.

t3_n76h0l,What are some of the old film tricks or features that today's generation might not understand?,gxb8km9,"Slight correction - cue marks never went away as far as 35mm was concerned. There were still mom and pops out there that couldn't afford to switch to the platter system so they had to stay. Now, even with a 2 projector system they could often use 6,000 foot reels and for a moment there they did try switching over (I distinctly recall New Line trying it) but the 6,000 foot reels they shipped on were cheap and ultimately unwieldy to transport as opposed to Goldberg cans. This is just random, but I remember seeing Jurassic Park in DTS and being stunned that they continued a music cue from one reel into the next (it was as they were first touring the island). Ordinarily they would try to avoid that because of the potential pop (because heads and tails of reels are always getting cut and spiced). Since the film was in DTS, the analog pop didn't exist.

t3_n7p9ze,ELI5: why does the weather forecast sometimes put the chance of perception lower than 100% when it's already raining?,gxdx8zq,"The percentage you are seeing isn't actually ""percent chance it WILL rain"" but rather ""percent coverage of rain in a given area."" If you think about it like if an area is 4 boxes, and there's a 75% chance of precipitation, then 3 of the 4 boxes are going to get rain. Essentially any time you see even a 10% ""chance"" of rain, what they really mean is 10% of the area IS GOING to get rain, and if you're in that 10% then you're DEFINITELY getting rain. Does that make sense? Worded differently, ""if there's a 10% chance of rain what it really means is there's a chance I'm in that 10% of the area that will get rain."" On the opposite side, if there's a 90% chance of rain, it means 90% of the area you live it will get rain, and 10% is not. Unfortunately I don't fully understand how large an area or what parameters they use to decide what percentages to use, hopefully someone else can explain that further.",908

Right next to that place there is a big Picknick place on one side (you have to cross a small bride 6-7m length to get over the river to the Picknick area) and on the other side of the river there is the freshwater fountain that has the river with the brindge behind it and a steep cliff like area next to it and than some parking spaces. Well i was i think 9 or 10 or something at the time, and i was looking at this cliff like area and it had these every steep stairs and i imagined people using the stairs to climb up there. Basically these stairs aren't stairs of all but they are meant to stop debree stones and similar to fall down. Well i didn't know that at the time. I just thought to myself well if people climb up their regulary why can't I do that, i just really wanted to do it, so while my parents where picknicking i just went there and started to climb up like 10 ish meters, looking back at it, it makes no sense i even have fear of heights, why would I do that?

Heat a skillet over medium and add your cooking oil when hot, then add those veggies. Cook for like 3-5 minutes to soften - while they cook, chop your chicken into small bite-sized pieces. Add the coconut milk and curry powder to your pan, stir well to blend. Bring it to a boil, then add the chicken and simmer over medium heat until the chicken is done, about 20 minutes. I start the basmati rice about the same time I add the chicken, and put the rice and the curry side by side in a bowl while serving so you can mix them or eat a bite of either by itself.",1363

t3_n8eefy,ELI5 what is the biological reason for sexual arousal in women before their menstruation?,gxhy02d,"I don't know about the hormones and shit, but I do know that women only have their period because the body is shading the extra layers of tissue on her uterus that were supposed to hold and nourish the ovum after fecundation. It is more energy efficient for the body to produce and discard these extra tissue every month than it is to maintain it there always ready, so the body has to make the most use of it on the few days it is ""ready"". Most women go through hormonal changes through their cycle and when they are ""ready"" this hormones makes them want to have more sex to not waste this chance. Every person is different though and some women say they prefer sex on other weeks of their cycles for a multitude of reasons that can be related to hormones or could just be about comfort for example, there is nothing wrong with that.",834

Really big Gong that doesn't produce sound, Kriss blades that suddenly gone missing and allegedly threw itself around if it doesn't get handled at least once a week, horse cart that won't budge unless he did some ritual beforehand, etc. It's hard to comprehend whether it's real or not since most modern human doesn't give a damn with things like that, but I swear there's different aura around those objects. It's like looking at a very dark forest kinda vibe. He used to have Kriss blade to protect himself, it's also have some sort of power where it can only hurt someone who have malicious intent towards him. I tried to touch the blade and it's very dull, but he assured me that it could cuts extremely well. After he died, the Kriss are kept inside a locked drawer filled with his thing. Every friday around 12-3 AM, it randomly banged on the drawer wall. His family can't take em anymore because there's more and more strange phenomenon happening, called few Ustadz that's specialised in Ruqyah (think of John Constantine, a specialist in exorcism), gave prayer and blessing to the blade, and it fixed it. Most of the spooky items pretty much neutralised and safe to keep. That being said, he also have other Kriss and some of them mysteriously gone missing while we blessed all those spooky stuff.

She was trying to get title back into her name, and the guy would promise to sign a deed and then not do it. We had a real estate paralegal who did a search on the property and prepared a deed which transferred the property to her. The guy agreed to meet with the woman and me at his home (not the house in question). He was a smirky jerk. He taunted the woman and me about transferring title. I showed him the deed and asked him to sign it, not expecting him to do so. I was sure we'd have to sue to clear title. He looked at the deed. ""You want me to sign this?"" I said yes, and he did! I was shocked. He smirked. The woman wailed, ""But that's not his real name. That's his fake name!"" I told her that was the name he held title to the house. HUGE wipe off of the smirk on him and big change to smile on her. I went back to the office, gave the deed to the paralegal, who filed the deed and got title back in her name.

t3_nc5suf,How is Clark Kent ripped?,gy4ghlb,"Why is a Tiger in a zoo ripped? Look at them, they are all solid muscle with not much fat on them unless they really work at it. The trick is for tigers, their natural state is to be muscled up and they don't really need to exercise to get to a much higher level of fitness than a human being does. So Kryptonians are like that. Clark, on a proper diet, basically fills out to full muscle mass. In some comics he actually swells slightly if you put him in a suit so Ma Kent had to be careful when buying clothes for him. Because he is naturally in a muscled state, he doesn't need to work out like a conventional human would. Basically, he has a genetic switch flipped that has his muscles build up mass whenever possible. The reason we aren't like this is because evolution figured out that's terrible for long term survival. Keeping up large amounts of unnecessary muscle mass means our ancestors needed a bunch of extra calories and those calories were in short supply. Occassionally you see a human with that switch flipped and then you get kids like Kyle Kane or Richard Sandrak, and if you read up on them they are just like that. They don't exercise much beyond what they are doing and are buff as all get out.",1217

t3_nc6fm2,"ELI5: why does crypto need to be ""mined""? if its digital why cant it just exist?",gy37exp,"If there was no mining, someone could just decide ""I have million coins"". Mininig in this context is not mining. The coins are just created from thin air as real money, but they are not created randomly. If you want to send someone some crypto, you are just adding that transaction to a list. * ""A sent B 10 coins"" * ""B sent C 5 coins"" * ""C sent A 5 coins"" But how to know that these are true? And why can't anyone just alter the history of transactions? (Note: following explanation is simplified version, and might not be entirely accurate) This is where the blockchain comes to play. Let's add all those transactions an perform a mathematical hash function on them, to turn that into a certain length of bits. If might look like this: 098gaa576a2653. Well, that was not very hard. Let's try to find a different hash, such that we get for example 6 zeros at the beginning. Let's add some random data at the end of our list, and also the previous hash from previous block in to the list: * ""78687576567acaa"" * ""A sent B 10 coins"" * ""B sent C 5 coins"" * ""C sent A 5 coins"" * ""00000001"" Now the hash might be: 675gfac6534453 Well, no luck, let's try again: * ""78687576567acaa"" * ""A sent B 10 coins"" * ""B sent C 5 coins"" * ""C sent A 5 coins"" * ""011188811"" Let's try all kinds of random data, until we find a hash, like 000000afa667a Now we found a hash that looks as it should. It was difficult, as we had to try millions and millions of different bits of data to find this. We save this to the blockchain. Because it was very hard thing to do, we get a reward, the coins. This is what mining is. Blockchain is the list of transactions, and their hashes in order. The specific kind of hash was incredible hard to calculate, but it's easy to just check if that is the correct hash. Now if I try to change something, like giving ourself more coins, the hash would no longer be the same. Because the hashes are chained together, everyone knows that someone tried to tamper it as none of the hashes match anymore. We could try to re-calculate the hashes, but that would take way longer than anyone has time, and because millions of users have the original blockchain, no-one would believe if someone tried to cheat.",2209

t3_nc70a2,Are we morally responsible for our actions inside our dreams?,gy4qnry,"Are we morally responsible for our actions inside our video games? Intuitively, I think no and it's by the same intuition which I feel about dreams. Importantly, I would rule out agency as a significant factor in the moral status of an action, or at least, suggest that there is some concept that must supercede agency because in video games we do have agency (though you may argue in degrees of agency). I bring this up because I was a natural lucid dreamer as a kid and for a long time believed this was the norm. Not only did I have full control over my own actions, I could freely manipulate reality as I saw fit. If you were to hold me accountable for the knowing and deliberate things I did in dreams... well, it'd be simultanouely worse than any atrocities a person is capable of in reality and greater than any goods a person is capable of in reality. It'd also be very different to how I conduct myself in reality. Why? For the same reasons I can play different characters in video games: role playing. I think the reason is consequence. When consequence is stripped away actions are inherently meaningless and rendered amoral. This supercedes other considerations like agency. I think there's lots of room to get into philosophical weeds here, but ultimately the important thing is that dreams do not impact reality and therefore we are free to act however we please and should not be judged on those actions. There is another angle here, however, the idea that dreams reflect our unconscious self, our biases and tendencies. In this, a lack of agency is exactly the critical factor by which we can purport to access this unconscious self. Should we then be judged based on this unconscious self? Probably not. For the same reason we should be judged on actions, not on thoughts. This unconscious self is not tempered by reason, it doesn't carry our ability to rationalize and consider consequences. This process of reasoning is an important part of who we are, I think, and it would be unfair to take it away and then say ""look how awful your true self is!"". No, that's not me, that's like... some raw ore that has the potential to be me. Okay, okay, but what if you're not aware that you're dreaming, but you're fully agential and rational? Well then you're just going to behave as you would in the waking world anyway. So to synthesize, if you know you're dreaming, you know your actions have no consequences and if you don't know you're dreaming you're missing the ability to rationalize consequences. Either way, you're not really YOU and you shouldn't be judged for the actions you take.",2603

He would then choose one “good” paper and one “bad” paper. The class after we turned them in, all the desks would be turned towards the center of the room in a circle formation. We all sat in silence for the first 15ish minutes to read the papers. Then he made literally everyone in the class give a reason why the good paper was good and a way that the bad paper could improve. It was the most disgusting thing I had ever witnessed a teacher do, people left that class crying. Imagine hearing 20+ different ways why your paper was terrible. Needless to say I ripped him to shreds on his eval. Side note, he also made a comment about how people who wear Hollister are losers on a day I was wearing Hollister. Not sure if he noticed or not, as it was a nice sweater that had a very small bird in the bottom corner.

You are right that the results can have no meaningful impact on any real-world problem. But, this is common for math research.

A great example of this is [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem). Nobody really cared if it turned out to be true or not, since the theorem wasn't at all useful. Yet, people worked on the problem for centuries which resulted in the development of modern number theory which IS used to solve useful problems.

It is possible and even seems natural to some to sleep with their eyes open or in unusual positions (I am that person too, I like to fall asleep kinda kneeling with my head against the wall and eyes open, I just zone out to the land of dreams lol). But it's probably unhealthy somehow. Closing your eyes means seeing less light, and darkness stimulates the production of melatonine aka sleep hormone, which makes you tired, and, well, sleepy. Relaxing your body to sleep - I can explain it but can't word it good enough probably, as English is not my first language and I think in images. Animals have to feel safe to sleep. Ever had a cat fall asleep on your lap? Congratulations, the cat trusts you and believes that you are not dangerous. Same with people. Imagine just randomly taking a nap on a very crowdy street, or at some protests. Hardly possible, I guess. Feeling unsafe causes muscle tension and being ready to react.

t3_nevt7b,"Eli5, Why do the rpm in a manual transmission fall when changing gears?",gyie92l,The engine is connected to the transmission directly. The engine flywheel and the transmission input shaft spin at the same speed. In a manual transmission when you change gear the clutch disconnects the engine from the transmission then reconnects the engine to the transmission. This disconnection will result in engine speed falling if you don’t keep your foot on the accelerator. When you change the gear ratio the engine must lower its RPM to match the transmission speed for the wheel speed in the new longer gear ratio. Imagine if you will: an engine at 1000rpm in 1st gear with 1:1 gear ratio going 1 mile per hour. The transmission and the engine are both spinning 1000 rpm to go 1 mile per hour at the transmission output shaft. If I change gears to 2nd gear at 1:0.5 gear ratio the transmission outputshaft will now be going 500 rpm to move the car at 1 mile per hour. Thus I have to reduce my engine speed to 500rpm to maintain the 1:1 ration at the engine to transmission connection.,996

t3_ngdmdz,eli5: What’s a “liquidation event” in Crypto?,gyqozza,"Basically there are crypto trading platforms where you can lend the service provider's money to ""boost"" your buying power. For example if I would use 10x leverage on $5 I would suddenly have $50 to trade with. So if the price does go in your favour you will be making more than you would have had without leverage, but theres also a risk to lose a lot more. In case the leveraged trade indeed goes south then there's a liquidation price that comes in. When I leveraged my $5 to $50 and the markets turn, causing me to go -$5 I would instantly get liquidated. The platform instantly closes your position when you dont have the money to back up your leverage and I would lose my $5 aswell. Crypto markets took a big dump today, causing leverage traders to get liquidated and thus causing a liquidation event.",806

t3_ngwj3o,How do I increase my emotional intelligence?,gytxfzh,"Concur with the point about learning to listen to people. The more you understand what typically drives people's actions and decisions the more you're able to read it in the moment. Asking lots of questions in 1:1 conversations and trying to understand why people feel the way they do is also just great conversational style. Emotional intelligence also includes your own feelings, however. Journaling and meditation help here. When you sit with your thoughts and put them into words you'll see more clearly when something like that happens again. Most of the time we act on autopilot based off of emotions we're not consciously aware of. Journaling can help to unpack this because instead of just ""I was angry in that meeting"" you can get to ""I felt like i was being attacked because they didn't choose my idea."" This recognition will allow you to process your own emotions better next time because you know that you often take things personally or fear getting rejected etc. Sam Harris's Waking Up app is my favorite meditation tool, highly recommend!",1053

""what time is it man?"" thats when, he said it. it haunts me to this day, these words creapt out of his little mouth, he said, ""about *tree-fiddy*"" and his skin began to decompose off of his body, his teeth grew larger and his eyes elongated. fear, pulsed through my body, he grew larger, his bones audibly cracked, his back got larger, and spirits started chanting around me, the birds chirped louder, the class stared in shock, as his limbs grew longer and his flesh was being torn off his body. but even in this state, he recognized me. he left the class alone, and ran into the great tahoe woods, they say a skin walker still roams through the woods, and legend is, if you said *tree-fiddy* he appears.",3011

I told him he could walk away from me at anytime but he could see it was hurting me bc I had feelings for him and he had feelings for her. I’d asked him a few weeks before if I could spend his bday with him since he was off that day but the Friday before we had a talk and decided it was probably time to stop. Even though he swore he only had plans with his mom for his birthday he said he didn’t feel ok about me coming over the night before - even though I’d planned to leave in the afternoon. I knew that ending things would happen eventually but the fact that he decided he’d prefer to spend his birthday alone (allegedly) than hang out with me for a few hours really hurt.

I worry that others will piss on Japanese music as a whole because these aren't sung the best. Personally, I LIKE that they aren't sung the best. They don't need to be. I think that makes them so unique and different from what's out there, not to mention the singer is a tenor, if not soprano at times, which is so rare in this kind of music (in fact, the singer may be the only one with this range in this genre).

t3_nixpaj,Could you guys offer your best tools/advice on how to plan a self-learning semester please?,gz4rw5d,"I am pretty good at this, but I wasn't always good at it. I think the key that might help you is to break it down into parts, and conveniently most subjects taught in University are already broken down into parts for you, be that chapters in a textbook or homework, activities, and tests. So instead of thinking of it like ""I want to learn Hindi ..."" (the language), you instead break it down into something you can actually learn with measurable success, such as ""I want to learn to draw the characters in the Hindi alphabet"", which you can further break down into ""I want to learn this character ..."", or ""I want to learn to draw the vowels ..."". You just keep breaking it down until you have a plan that you feel will lead you to success, something that you can make progress on, instead of some giant insurmountable goal like ""I want to learn Hindi .."", which is basically impossible to do as a task. Then it is a matter of record keeping, allowing yourself the freedom to fail and get bored and wander off to do something else occasionally, making your goal re-entrant so that once you do get bored and wander off you can come back to it and pick back up on it, etc. Sometimes you will hit roadblocks and have to negotiate around them, the usual stuff. So in terms of your University work, .. that is already broken down into parts for you. So that's how I would approach it. Don't think about ""I want to learn \[insert subject\]"" and try to tackle it as a semester, but instead look at whatever you learn in a single class and try to tackle that. Maybe that was just one kind of math problem that was trying to teach you one very specific math rule or something. So learn that rule. Get on Youtube and look around and try to find various professors teaching that rule. Find some practice problems and work them, really LEARN that rule. Then once you have it, move on to whatever you learned in the second class. I mean that's why they break it down like this, why you have homework problems, etc, why you are taught a certain amount each week and have all this ""free time"" in University (i.e. the time you're supposed to be studying) ... so you have time to really learn what is being taught. I'm really good at learning on my own. I have used this example before because it is a good illustrative thing I can point to about learning things and self-improvement, but last year I learned to drive a tractor trailer ""on my own"". I put that in quotes because I did have people teaching me at various times, but I was the one managing the learning, .. i.e. I didn't go to ""truck driver school"" to learn. Instead I broke the task down into parts and found a way to learn the individual parts. So, for example, there is a ""pre trip inspection"" part that I learned by watching Youtube videos and going out and practicing on trucks that I had access to. Later I learned to back the trucks up. I learned to do brake checks. I learn to do in cab inspection on my own. I learned to drive the trucks (here I needed help, of course), etc. I just broke the task down, and I learned the individual parts. Then I tested and got a Class-A license. There's nothing magical about ""learning by yourself .."", all it is is learning how to teach, and then teaching yourself. You are basically your own University professor, you are figuring out a lesson plan (for yourself), and then holding classes (for yourself), demanding homework (of yourself), and giving yourself tests, etc, ... the trick is that you are learning to manage your own learning. That, itself, as a skill you master through constant practice ... meaning that the ability to learn on your own is, in fact, an ability that you will learn on your own, if that makes any sense. It's a skill that you will get better at through practice. You are essentially learning to learn by yourself, by learning, by yourself.",3862

And when I was learning how to write, one of the first sentences I ever wrote in my journal was, “My mom is mean that me. She should go to jail.” I didn’t *cut my family off* - I *escaped* my family. The only thing I regret is that people respond with, “But they’re your parents!” When you explain that you don’t speak to your parents anymore.

t3_njh3ry,"What does it mean for something to be ""real""?",gz863vh,"Depends what your context is. If you think that ""real"" is synonymous with ""objective"" then you can have two ways of thinking about reality. You can think of objective like the 3rd person intersubjective agreement, or objective like in the classic sense, which is devoid of subjectivity (Pierce). They are not mutually exclusive, but we typically speak in the former sense for everyday things. So a mystical experience like hallucinations could be deemed as real if there is an agreement that such experiences occur. But for the classical sense of objective reality, the answer seems not be as clear since, as you said, it is a distinct subjective experience. One would have to determine if such an experience counts as an objective part of reality, maybe doing some Nagel-esque formulating of the ""complete picture of the word"". But as for the content of hallucinations, they are purely subjective and thus not objective in either sense.",937

Sometimes the official retail experience does suck, too. Like having to deal with a midnight release crowd to get a new sneaker. Why shouldn't people be able to pay $100 to have someone do that nonsense for them? Also those sneaker releases are artificially limited and annoying on purpose, to build hype and get all those stories about people desperately waiting in line for the not new product. The company is making the experience crappy for their biggest fans in order to sell more stuff. Now I agree that scalping is annoying... but I see it more as the inevitable result of limited supply. I don't really blame the individual scalpers, they're just cogs in the wheel. Manufacturers and retailers *could* bypass most of this crap, but it's in their interest not to.",1136

t3_nk87xq,Is there a philosopher who attempted to justify eating meat/dairy?,gzbtbhz,"Traditionally, Kant is understood as justifying eating meat. See e.g. [here](https://www.openbookpublishers.com/htmlreader/978-1-78374-388-9/ch14.xhtml#:~:text=Kant%20says%20of%20a%20person,in%20his%20dealings%20with%20men%E2%80%9D.&amp;text=Perhaps%20it%20is%20the%20case,or%20an%20endorsement%20of%2C%20cruelty.) - for Kant, what gives us rights is personhood, and animals are not persons. Personhood means we are rational creatures able to figure out our duties, which animals can't - hence they aren't capable of having rights, either. (Don't misunderstand old Immanuel here to say we can mistread animals.

t3_nlj73r,Is it normal for work done by research assistants to be largely ignored by the lab group?,gzk7snn,"Do you have regular meetings with your advisor or someone else that could give you feedback? If not, could you talk with the PhD student whose data you're working on, or the post-doc, to get specific feedback on things? This would be my suggestion if lab meetings are viewed as somewhat more formal or if you bring it up and the advisor doesn't think your work would be suited to presenting in lab meeting. I have personally found that having one-on-one meetings with the people who are directly involved or do research highly related to my topic give the best feedback, and help me grow more as a researcher. Whereas in lab meetings there can be less incentive to dive deeply into things that are/are not working and suggest changes or ways to improve the work. When people are in the weeds of figuring out analysis, group feedback hasn't been the most useful. Keep in mind that the purpose of lab meetings can vary a lot from lab to lab as well. In my lab group, lab meeting is very informal and we almost never have enough people wanting to present to fill up all of the lab meeting time. Usually when people present their work, it's either very end stage (comments on a manuscript draft before sending to a journal, polishing a talk that's going to be given a week later) -- or on the complete opposite end and for fun, ex.

t3_nm1sw6,ELI5: how do we know that light is the fastest thing?,gzm22h0,"It's not that light is the fastest thing, exactly. It's that there is a speed limit to the universe, and light happens to travel at that speed (as does anything without mass). Basically, the constant 'c' is a number that came out of a set of electromagnetism equations known as ""Maxwell's Equations"" after the scientist who combined them, James Clark Maxwell. They are a collection of four laws that relate to things like how much electric field comes out of a certain amount of charge, how much moving a charge creates magnetic fields, and so on; examples include Gauss's Law and Ampere's law. These were all known before Maxwell's time from experiments. Maxwell showed that by mixing and matching these laws for a space with zero charges in it, you could describe a wave made up of electric and magnetic fields that wibble-wobble back and forth and travel at a specific constant speed (which is based on other constants that were already known from Ampere's Law, Gauss's law, etc.) That electromagnetic wave is light. The reason that nothing can travel faster than that constant speed is from Einstein's theory of relativity - when Einstein was doing thought experiments using Maxwell's equations, he found that you could create a situation in which, by putting an electromagnetic coil on a very fast moving train (close to the speed of light), Maxwell's equations said you could get infinite energy out of the system. Einstein reasoned that this was probably not how the universe worked - infinite energy should not be possible. As he worked through the math, which is all quite complicated, the only way he could resolve the problem is if nothing could travel faster than 'c' - it had to be the speed limit for the universe. So much so, that if there was something that WOULD go faster than 'c', time and space would have to bend themselves in unexpected ways to make sure that noone would be able to have an object travelling faster than c (which would allow them to get infinite energy).",1993
t3_nm48tr,What can be done with the problem of uncertainty?,gzmhsyv,"&gt; I wonder why university philosophy professors are still reiterating the words of philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Socrates, only to name a few. It is not surprising because their words weren't truthful or profound, it is surprising because of the exponential advancements of human knowledge and technology since their words were spoken. This isn't really true. Most papers, articles and books are going to overwhelmingly references papers, articles and books written in the past 40 years. You can verify this by looking at any article on the SEP, for instance the free will articles cites around 170 articles published in the 21st century, 120 articles published in the 20th century, 3 published in the 18th century and 0 published in the 19th century. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/#Bib &gt;I guess my question, is how can we rightfully make any decisions, without any measurable standard of what is wrong and what is right? It would be hard I imagine, possibly impossible, but I don't think many or any Philosophers think we have no 'measurable standard of what is wrong and what is right'.",1121
t3_nm7rjs,ELI5: Why does wavelength affect diffraction?,gzn8k2e,"This is a long one. TL,DR at the end. Preamble for context: To ask WHY a wave does anything is difficult, since a wave is more of a description of how energy is propagating through a collection of what I'll call ""points""† rather than a definite object. In Physics when we talk about WHY a wave does something we're doing a little bit of anthropomorphising of the wave. Usually this is okay, as it helps make some of the more abstract stuff go down easier, but in the case of WHY a wave's wavelength affects diffraction, it becomes problematic. This is because diffraction isn't a property of the wave, it's an emergent property of the wave-gap system as a whole. †could be transverse waves, or longitudinal waves, and could be through matter; molecules, atoms, etc., or it could be more Quantumy stuff like light that I could go into, but it would make this very much not ELI5-y Okay main answer: In this situation, it's best to think of a wave front (the horizontal lines on most diffraction diagrams - could represent the peaks or troughs of a wave) as a series of many individual wave SOURCES. That is, each point on the wave front creates new circular waves of the same wavelength, propagating outward. Re read that last paragraph and make sure you GET that idea. Search ""Huygens-Fresnel Principle"" on google images if you need some more visualisation. Don't scroll too far though some of the diagrams are weird and scary. The second diagram on the Huygens–Fresnel principle Wikipedia page is a good one imo. Okay, now just think about a single wave front that is right in the middle of the slit. ===----=== (if === is the opaque barrier and --- is the wave) If we draw circular waves coming from many points along that wave front, the physical wave that results (due to interference) is going to have a certain shape which is going to depend on how wide the slit is (or, technically on the distance between the first and last of our wavelet sources on the wave front, but assuming we've got a great number of them, the slit size is essentially equivalent). Again the Wikipedia diagram can help visualise this. Stop here and make sure you have that last bit properly visualised. Don't move on until you get it. Now for the more tricky bit. Imagine making the slit wider, and what effect that would have on the diffraction. Hopefully you can see how the diffraction is less pronounced as more of the wavelet sources contribute primarily to the ""flat"" portion of the final wavefront. Now do it the other way, make it smaller. Can you see that the diffraction is now more pronounced for the opposite reason? [obligatory visualisation checkpoint. Ihre Papiere bitte!] Let's assume the opaque barrier that the slit is in has zero width. There's no material that does this but the thickness of our barrier isn't something necessary to consider and makes the next bit trickier to visualise. Scale up EVERYTHING in our experiment. Make the wavelength bigger, the slit bigger, all of it. You've got the same situation right? Without a scale on the diagram, we SHOULD have no way to tell by how much we've made it all bigger. Now make the slit smaller (and let's assume you've done this such that the slit is back to it's original size, for simplicity). The first bit, scaling up the whole thing, has no effect. The second bit, scaling the slit back down, is the same effect as the second visualisation we did before the last checkpoint. Go back and have a look if you need to. Move on once you can imagine everything up to this point. So, what IS the difference between 'making the slit smaller', and 'scaling everything up but keeping the slit the same size'? The difference is the wavelength. And for our thought experiment, *only* the wavelength. (Other properties may have changed but these aren't shown on the Wikipedia diagram, nor have we been considering them, and wouldn't have an effect anyway) This is how to imagine the mechanism by which the wavelength affects diffraction; because the slit size can only really be measured *relative to* the wavelength and vice versa. Hopefully the first part of my answer helped you understand the mechanism by which slit size affects diffraction as well. As for why, like I said at the very beginning; the thing we call a wave is a collection of lots of points interacting with other points nearby, so to paraphrase Yoda, a ""wave"" does or does not. There is no why. Don't worry too much if you still don't really get it. Even Physicists don't really get it, and given that ""why"" isn't an easily definable question in Physics, you don't actually ever need to know why other than to satisfy your own curiosity. I'm happy to answer any follow up questions or clarify something if you need me to. TL,DR; Go and read it. The only TL,DR I can give is that you're asking the wrong thing. Waves just do diffract, and wavelength just does affect it.",4884

t3_nms1a9,ELI5: Why can't a sine and cosine angle be greater than 1?,gzqfkdj,"Start with the unit circle -- a circle of radius 1 [in whatever units], centered at the origin. Draw this. Pick a point on the circle and draw the radius to it. Also draw the vertical line to the x-axis, and the horizontal line to the y-axis. The angle is measured from the positive x-axis counterclockwise around to the radius. By definition, the height of the point above or below the x-axis is the sine of the angle. Likewise, the distance of the point left or right of the y-axis is the cosine of the angle. Now, no point on the circle can be more than 1 from the center; the most the sine and cosine can be is 1 (or –1). What about bigger circles? Then the sine is the ratio of the height to the circle's radius, and similarly for the cosine. So, if the point is at coordinates (x,y), the radius is r = sqrt[x^2 + y^(2)] by the Pythagorean Theorem. And the sine is y/r while the cosine is x/r. Again, the magnitude of these ratios is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 1.",980

Some people believe they are separated from one another, others believe we are all one. The world is one, but we are seeing it very differently. The thing about philosopher is that they put a lot of effort trying to describe how and why they see the world in a specific way.

However since Thawe lived in the future long after Barry lived he decided to go back in time to meet his hero, resulting in him visiting the Flash museum of this time and discovering that he would become the Reverse Flash, the Arch nemesis of Barry Allen!

Her vocabulary also was not too great, and she would absolutely say “dick” instead of “penis” in general conversation (though I think she would say “penis” if needed in conversation with a patient, that never came up). This is relevant. Well one day I’m working and preparing charts (I started visit notes before patients would come to make charting easier) and I notice a woman is on the schedule for a spot check appointment for “spot on ____/pussy discharge.” (I don’t remember where the spot was- probably back or arm or leg). All day I’m thinking, well we aren’t gynecology, but maybe there is a cyst on the vulva, or maybe it was one of those “and also” moments, which we got a lot. Many providers in the office were female and would check the vulva, labia, and even inside the vagina - surely the receptionists would let the patient know we might not get to the “pussy discharge.” Even still, it’s a weird thing to put for a medical clinic. But again, kind of expected for the receptionist. Patient comes in, and upon intake we realize the issue.

His critique of pure reason is key on your question If you want a brief run of how all of these go, it's pretty much: ""You can't know anything for sure"" -&gt; ""You can know that you exist for sure"" -&gt; a spicy argument between a bunch of guys arguing whether rationality necessitates external experiences (i.e. our senses) -&gt; There is the stuff you can't know, the stuff you can know, and there's the stuff we inject into the unknowable so that it can be known by humans. Kant basically came in while everyone was bickering, invented a whole bunch of words, blew everyone's minds and then sent the modern era of philosophy on it's way. [Schopenhauer](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer/#3) critiqued and clarified a lot of Kant's work, and [Nietzsche](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/#PoweLife) really just took epistemology from a cultural sense and leveraged it into his Will to Power. Then people more or less moved onto other topics in philosophy (at least in western philosophy).",2096
t3_nol1mh,ELI5: why do our bodies feel worse when we lounge around all day?,h00ufh5,"Your body has a circulatory system. The heart, lungs, arteries, veins, and capillaries are like a pump and piping system for your body. Their job is to deliver oxygen and nutrients to all the cells of your body. When this system functions well, your body and all its cells are happy. When you lay around all day you tend to breath shallow and have a low heart rate and blood pressure. This means your circulatory system isn’t pumping blood around your body super effectively. Oxygen and nutrients aren’t getting into all the nooks and crannies as well as they could be. This stagnation makes you feel lethargic and weak. You might notice that if you haven’t exercised in awhile and you suddenly go for run you might get all itchy, particularly on your thighs, butt, and torso. This is because the increased activity is forcing blood into capillaries and activating nerves that haven’t been used in some time. This is also why stretching, massage, and heat is good for recovery and injuries. It increases blood flow to the affected area and helps the healing process. There are other psychological and physiological reasons but those are more complicated. Overall, your brain and body is happier with exercise and good blood flow. EDIT: [HERE](https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness/runners-itch#takeaway) is a link talking about reasons for itchiness during exercise.",1370

It is easy/fast to check if the problem was solved without going trough the effort of solving it yourself. 3. You can transform the problem in to any other equivalent NP-complete problem. What the other commenters are saying isn't *strictly* correct, because they are assuming the solution to a famous unsolved computer science problem: that P is not equal to NP. The set of P problems are any problems that can be solved quickly The set of NP problems are problems whose solution can be verified quickly.

Probably one of the biggest things is the CMOS sensor, in other words digital cameras. Another is artificial heart pumps used in surgeries. We could develop them because of the software NASA uses to simulate fuel in rocket engines. This has permeated our society, pretty much all technology you use today got advanced in some way or form by NASA and NASA-related work. 2. Basic research. This is stuff that expands our fundamental understanding of the universe, which in turn lets us create new technologies. Sometimes this doesn't turn into something useful for decades or even centuries. Remember, technology at the end of the day stands on the shoulders of giants.

This is a question we talk about all the time. I personally think it comes down to what we ask our students to do, and how much support/scaffolding we offer. If we assign tasks that feel meaningless, and confusing, and we aren’t checking in along the way to see how they’re doing/offer support, and we’re not explaining clearly how to succeed - enthusiasm is going to be low. If we assign tasks that feel meaningful, authentic, and connected to students’ lives, and if we ensure that success criteria is clearly understood by all - enthusiasm is going to be higher. If we can offer them a choice at any point, this helps too. Choice can be in terms of what we study, as well as what products the students produce. For example: “We’re going to do a poetry unit.

Once you’ve been rolling along at a relatively stable 50 MPH or so, it stops feeling “fast”. When you’re on an uninclosed bike, you have the constant feeling of wind rushing over your face and dragging on your body to remind you how fast you are moving, even if you are going comparatively slow.

t3_n3cmgx,ELI5 What makes some metals stronger than others?,gwpezlq,"Metal atoms are organized by arranging themselves into many repeated pieces called [unit cells](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/unit%20cell). Pure metals such as iron, gold, tin, and aluminum only have one type of atom in their unit cell structure. For example, a piece of aluminum foil is made up of tons of organized aluminum atoms. Metallic alloys, such as steel, brass, and bronze all have more than one type of element in their structures. For example, steel has a mostly iron structure with carbon atoms dispersed throughout. The different crystal structures of alloys and pure metals directly affect their physical properties, such as strength or hardness. For example, pure iron (a.k.a Ferrite) forms a [body-centered cubic](https://www.lff-group.com/posts/carbon-steel-fundamentals-part-1) (BCC) unit cell, a cube with an iron atom in the center and atoms at each corner. The unit cell of steel is called [face-centered cubic](https://www.lff-group.com/posts/carbon-steel-fundamentals-part-1) (FCC) with atoms on all corners as well as faces. Generally speaking, pure metals have BCC structures and alloys have FCC structures. The Bitesize webpage of the British Broadcasting Corporation states that alloys are [harder and stronger](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8db7p3/revision/2) than pure metals because there are more atoms occupying the FCC structure than the BCC structure. As seen on Professor Marzari’s illustrations of unit cells in her MIT [lecture slides](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/materials-science-and-engineering/3-012-fundamentals-of-materials-science-fall-2005/lecture-notes/lec16b_note.pdf), there are two total atoms in the BCC unit cell and four total atoms in the FCC unit cell. This difference in microstructures results in a “[greater force required \[to distort\] the layers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z8db7p3/revision/2)” of atoms in alloys than in elemental metals. In other words a higher concentration of atoms leads to a stronger material. This also explains why an elemental metal like titanium, [which has a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure](https://www.phase-trans.msm.cam.ac.uk/2004/titanium/titanium.html) (HCP) is so strong. HCP has a very tightly packed structure making it difficult to pull the atoms and move them around. There are many other factors that cause metals to be stronger than others, such as oxidation, temperature, and heat treatment, but the atomic structure is the most basic and important reason.",2501

t3_n4mini,"ELI5: If lipids have twice as much energy as carbohydrates, why is glucose used in respiration?",gwwnuv2,"Technically, what's used in respiration is a thing called an acetyl group, which is two carbon atoms with some extra bits. This is what is processed by the mitochondria into CO2, water and a bunch of energy, and the energy ""value"" of a calorific molecule is just a matter of how good that molecule is at providing acetyl groups. Lipids are long chains of carbon atoms. Every two carbon atoms can easily be snapped off and converted into an acetyl group and carried to the mitochondria. That's really efficient for storing energy, then. Glucose is 6 carbon atoms, but it can only make two acetyl groups due to the way the cell converts glucose. Comparing carbon atoms, glucose makes 4 ""useful"" carbon atoms out of 6, but lipids can make 4 useful carbon atoms out of 4, which is a much better ratio. The unique benefit of glucose is that some energy is also produced from anaerobic respiration. Glycolysis, the process of converting glucose to pyruvate (the step just before acetyl), releases a small amount of energy even before the mitochondria get involved, but it also uses up a limited resource called NAD. This NAD gets contaminated with hydrogen, and for glycolysis to continue, it needs to be cleaned. Fortunately, the mitochondria can take the hydrogen off the NAD and convert it into energy and water molecules. That's what's happening in aerobic respiration. Unfortunately, they need oxygen to do it, cos you can't make water out of just hydrogen. When oxygen isn't available, the body can still refresh NAD, but all the energy that was in the contaminating hydrogen gets lost, instead of converted into usable form. That's not ideal, but it's better than nothing, and glucose's ability to be better than nothing in poor conditions is really useful. Glucose is also the only thing that nerve cells use for fuel. We're not entirely sure why that is, but some good theories exist around things like glucose metabolism doing less damage to cells, being faster, and requiring less oxygen even when aerobic respiration is available (a lot of oxygen is burned in lipid -&gt; acetyl conversion).",2097

The original backers (the Water Merchants) needed a handy token to engage in commerce without needing to fuck around with the barter system, so they say ""alrighty, we'll take bottle caps for water at a rate of X caps to Y water"". For a merchant group operating in the apocalypse, this is a pretty good arrangement, since they don't need to dick around trying to print bills or stamp coins; they just let the wasteland scavengers do the heavy lifting and focus on the water. By FO2, they're still worthwhile. Civilization is rising again, but it's still at the city-state level. ""Proper"" currency exists, but tends to be local, because no one really wants to legitimize their rival by adopting their currency ad their own. Caps provide a ""neutral"" currency that none of the players control, at least not directly. By New Vegas, caps are pretty much only hanging on because of the cultural cache of being *the* currency of the wasteland, combined with House wanting a coin of the realm that A) he doesn't need to waste his time making, B) doesn't let the NCR use their fiscal policy to fuck with him, and C) will be accepted by partisan who would turn up their nose at NCR paper or Legion coin.

So, to port the old game you can (1) Translate each individual game to run on new hardware or (2) Pretend to be the old hardware. Obviously, if you plan on porting more than one game, option 2 is better because it's reusable, and that's what the Switch is doing. So the Switch hardware isn't just running the game, it's also running a software version of the entire SNES itself. The Switch's emulator also adds a rewind feature, which basically means it has to save the entire game state every second. Also, there could be inefficiencies in the design of the SNES itself that have to also be emulated in order to avoid breaking games. There could also be inefficiencies in the code of the game too. Normally, fast enough hardware would make those inefficiencies completely unnoticeable. But a lot of games were written specifically with the original hardware in mind, including the speed. So the emulator actually has to purposely run at the slower, original speed to preserve the intended speed of the game.",1067

There are ghost writers and other people that will write songs and sell them off to an artist or record company in which case the artist is usually just doing vocals/playing an instrument. However there is a bit of controversy about doing that kind of thing in some communities and instead musical artists are often expected to do everything on their own with maybe some help from a producer. If they have help from a producer then the artist is usually the one singing/playing an instrument while a producer would go in and put it all together, mix it, and/or add in some more beats. Overall, it really just depends on the artist and even their contract with a music record (if they have one) as they can also have some influence over what an artist creates.",888

t3_n8fvbf,Are logical deductions more true than inferences from empirical observations?,gxjn7h3,"I think you correctly identify the weaknesses of the kind of 'everyday reasoning' you describe and the kind of 'logical deduction' you described, but they represent two extremes on a continuum. So, really, the contrast between 'inference from observation' and 'logical deduction from premises' is too quick. For instance, we can make inferences from observation about premises that are then used in logical deduction about stuff we haven't observed yet. This is how Einstein deduced that during a solar eclipse we will be able to observe stars that really are behind the sun, because the sun will bend the light coming from the stars and so that it will kind of curve around it. Later Eddington observed that this is what actually happens. That is what the hypothetico-deductive method is all about. So, in a way we can use deduction to figure out what must be true given that the premises are true, but deduction can't really be used to tell us which premises are true. Observations can give us leads about the truth of the premises, but (as you point out) they can also lead us wrong. Another thing that is important to take into account is that it makes quite a difference what it is you are trying to figure out. In questions to do with abstract entities such as you find in mathematics, geometry, and formal logic (where you don't rely on observation at all), then there you sometimes can seem to find axioms that are self-evidently true (neither true by observation nor deduction). Euclidean geometry is built on 5 self-evident axioms (there are complications with one of them, but lets ignore that here) like 'the shortest path between two points is a straight line, etc. Given their truth we can deductively infer a lot in an a priori fashion. Point is, deductive reasoning seems to work pretty well for figuring out such abstract truths, but for figuring out stuff about physical reality it seems we have to rely on observation. We can however still use deduction there too, but it becomes more uncertain since we seem not to be able to determine any self-evident premises.",2082

t3_n8hdzn,"ELI5: Why do when rockets re-enters the atmosphere from space get burn up, but rockets that is going to space don't?",gxih0p0,"Rockets leaving the Earth aren't actually travelling all that fast while they are still within the dense part of the atmosphere. In order to achieve orbit, a rocket is shot straight up initially in order to get through the densest air that is the source of a lot of drag, but then they are pitched over so that they are eventually travelling sideways, parallel to the Earth's surface. They continue to accelerate for a long part of that manouver, because objects in orbit are basically falling just like anything else would - it's just that they are travelling so far horizontally during their fall that the Earth's surface curves away from the object at the same rate that the object is falling toward the Earth, resulting in net zero altitude difference. An object in orbit is simply just travelling sideways really, really fast. In order to slow down a spacecraft from orbital velocity, theoretically you could turn to face the opposite direction and thrust for the same amount of time to get back to zero horizontal velocity, but this would be extremely expensive in terms of fuel consumption and the upstream effects on rocket design to carry all that fuel and get it up to orbit in the first place. Instead, rockets make use of the atmosphere to slow them down. A short initial burn in the direction opposite of travel is used initially to cause the spacecraft to fall out of orbit, but then aerodynamic braking in the atmospheric air is actually used to take off most of the speed. The thing is, a deorbiting spacecraft is travelling so fast that air simply can't move out of the way fast enough, so instead it compresses in front of the advancing spacecraft, forming a shockwave some distance in front of the physical hull surface. This adiabatic compression generates an immense amount of heat that the spacecraft must be protected from, which is what heat shielding tiles are for. The attitude of the reentering spacecraft is controlled, and the shielding oriented properly during the reentry to protect the vehicle until it slows down sufficiently to land or deploy a parachute. If the vehicle is not controlled or sufficiently protected from the reentry heat, it burns up.",2184

We can also be a bit more scientific and compare the rock formations we see - our maps show roughly which bits were attached to which bits, and we can quite easily investigate the rock types and formations found at these points to see how they compare. Where they match closely it is a good hint that they were once part of the same landmass and split. You can also do the same with things like fossils - the same as nowadays, certain species lived in certain areas, so matching fossil types at opposite sides of the ocean are another marker to show they were connected.",918

I was older than 6 and I was adopted with two older biological siblings, one of whom was a teenager. Let me just state to anyone thinking about or in the process of doing this: Just because you chose to be their parent does not mean they have to chose to be your child. They will not bond to you immediately like a biological parent, they will always feel more connected to the idea of a birth parent or an actual birth parent. They might eventually love you more, sure, but they will always wonder and feel a sense of worthlessness or brokenness. ""Why didn't my parents love me enough?"" Also, so many adoptive parents that I have met and heard about that have horrible egos. They think they are a saint and deserve and endless supply of love and gratitude from their child(ren) for choosing to adopt. The child you adopt will never, ever be perfect. They will never be grateful all of the time, and they shouldn't have to be. Again, they didn't chose you. So many parents adopt in order to fulfill their idea of a perfect family.

t3_n9smnv,ELI5: What Causes JPEG Compression?,gxpk1y0,"Storing every pixel as a separate data point gets *really* expensive real fast when you're dealing with images consisting of millions of pixels. That's why compression formats exist. The two main types are lossless (which conserve all the data so a picture can be exactly reproduced) and lossy, which make sacrifices and remove some data in order to reduce the file size. For example, jpeg groups an area that's approximately the same color into one big square and writes the information of 50 pixels as only one or two large pixels. If you do this once it saves a ton of storage space and since our eyes don't actually perceive pixels the same way as a computer does, the image still looks nearly identical. If you do this many times however, you end up with multiple passes of an algorithm that compound the mistakes and approximations of the previous pass. Kind of like the telephone game that we played in kindergarten, each pass loses a bit more information. The best way to avoid it is to share the original image instead of compressing it again. Don't take a screenshot, but instead directly download the image for example. That way the compression is already written in the image and your phone doesn't need to do it again. Edit: jpeg does a lot more than just that obviously, but that's the most prominent feature that gives it that blocky look",1353

t3_nab6ts,Should new drivers get a $2000 car so if they crash it it's not a big deal or should they get a newer car with a lot of safety features (like a backup camera and blind spot detection) so there's less of a chance of them crashing in the first place?,gxsye8m,"Depends on where your budgeting is,where your finances lie, and how much you want to listen to statistics. Budgeting and finances route, you can either go cheap until they can afford to buy a better car for themselves, and if they dent or ding the car, it’s not a big problem. If you get a new car, there is more safety features, better tech, crumple zones, and driver safety features and ergonomics, at the cost of spending more money, and maybe being a bit more stressed if the vehicle is damaged or wrecked. With statistics; there is a couple stipulations... Usually, a high percentage of new/young drivers have a moderate to high risk of getting into a high speed accident, and a high to extreme risk of getting into a minor accident (distracted and fatigued driving is the most commonly known cause), so you take and apply that statistic, to the new driver(s) skillset and safe handling of a vehicle, and make a decision about wether to buy a newer or older vehicle, depending on what their risk factor is at, and how much you are able to spend in those cases. Hope this helps",1081
t3_nae6kg,"[Marvel/MCU] Not sure if this is the sub to go to but does anyone have any idea how many nanites are in the Mark L and Mark LXXXV suits, or has/would be willing to do the math to figure that out?",gxtcho9,"I would do it by taking a guess at the nanite size, Tony Stark's body's surface area, and the average thickness of his suit. Something like this: 0.5mm diameter cubic nanites (which take up a volume of 0.5^(3) = 0.125mm^(3)) . 2m^(2) body area (estimated from 6ft tall at 180lbs) and 2mm thickness ( like a thick coin ). 2m^(2) is 2,000,000mm^(2) and so the volume of the suit would be 4,000,000mm^(3). Divided by the nanite volume (0.125mm^(3)) would result in 32,000,000 nanites. If you halve the nanite diameter then it'll be 8 times as many (since the volume is the diameter^(3)). If you halve the suit thickness then it'll be half as many. Either way the numbers are in the tens to hundreds of millions. If the nanites are as small as a hair's thickness (\~0.1mm), then the number is in the billions.",805
t3_nagcx1,ELI5 how is a studio credited for making a commercial?,gxthew6,"The credits, or lack of credits, are generally agreed upon before the work is commissioned, and that's all part of the contract. It's standard practice that ad agencies/studios won't be credited in the ad itself, but sometimes they negotiate exceptions and include a credit or a splash screen, especially in situations where the ad may be considered a work of art in its own right. Adidas once commissioned a bunch of short-film style ads from a bunch of different creators for their [adicolor](https://vimeo.com/95786097) line, and all of those ads were published along with detailed info about who made them, for example. It's also not just in ads that credits are sometimes written out of the contract. Producing a creative work for hire confidentially and letting someone else claim credit for it (or leaving credit obscure) is often called ""Ghost writing."" It happens in the book and music industries, among others.",920

You can probably still walk around but it's just so annoying to do and it hurts a bit or a lot (emotionally, not physically). And sometimes you bump into something or you place your foot wrong and it hurts even more and you get reminded you are wearing your shoes wrong. That's kinda the feeling of dysphoria. Something is wrong but you can't exactly tell what but it does have some peaks that you get a spike in feeling like shit. Euphoria would be the opposite, after having worn your shoes wrong for a while when you put them on right it just feels amazing and comforting and it makes you happy. And just like euphoria if you get used to it at some point it's just going to be part of who you are and you don't need the extra spike in euphoria anymore.",796
t3_nay8vn,ELI5 why there is a gas shortage in the eastern US?,gxwcxt3,"The gas pipelines are controlled by computers. The people working at the sites use computers all the time for various things. All the sensor data is collected to computers. I have not seen any detailed information about exactly what they are doing and why they have to shut down the pipeline. However it is likely a precautionary measure. It is not unusual to take all computers offline after such an attack in order to scan them for any hidden software. If you leave some computers on it is possible that the malicious software might be able to copy itself between the computers and you may never get rid of it or even detect it. They are able to shut off the pipelines during this work because they know that the gas stations have enough gas in stock to delay the delivery for a few days under normal circumstances. New fuel deliveries are scheduled as normal at the end of this week. But just to make sure they did not go dry many gas stations increased their prices a bit which is an effective way of driving customers away or at least get them to wait until the end of the week to fill up their tanks again. The biggest concern is truckers, ships and airliners who are the big consumers of fuel and are therefore actively checking fuel prices everywhere and are able to change their plans to add fuel stops outside the effected area. However this backfired big time. People knew the fuel pipeline had shut down but did not know for how long and they saw the fuel prices starting to go up. So instead of running their fuel tanks a bit drier then normal a few enterprising people hoped to make a lot of money buy buying all the fuel that the gas stations had and selling them for highly inflated prices. So all the fuel that was supposed to be available at gas stations for people who could not wait until next week to fill their trucks is now locked away in crazy peoples garages. And as if people did not learn from the big toiletpaper hording last year gas stations will not take the gas back. And unlike toiletpaper gas will go bad if not stored professionally and it will destroy your property.",2102

If you look into the [naming conventions](https://www.thoughtco.com/explosions-deflagration-versus-detonation-607316), burning very fast is called deflagration, and actual explosives detonate. In any case, the *why* is down to the chemistry of burning - how fast oxygen in the atmosphere can react with the carbons and hydrogens in the fuel or explosive, to form carbon dioxide and water vapor. Even [iron burns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuUykfSzdgY) if oxygen can get at it efficiently enough. A majority of the explosives that detonate are made of chemicals that have the oxygen right there, built into the chemical formula, so that the burning reaction is fast enough to be a detonation rather than a ""burning"", and oxygen from the atmosphere is not needed for it.",842

I find going beyond 3 days too hard, YMMV, so will do a few of these in a month. Did that after Christmas holidays when I pigged out on a lot of great food many days in a row and quickly put on 10lbs lol. It was quickly shed. Remember that stupid Nickelback song with the lyric ""we'll all stay skinny cause we just won't eat""? Well, there is a lot of truth to that. I know not everybody can do a multi-day fast, but if you can, it really works quickly. A few of those in a month and you'll get dramatic results.

t3_nc7wqu,ELI5: Why does colours seem so much less vibrant after sleeping in the sun?,gy43ki1,"I would guess it has something to do with the pupillary light reflex. The pupil restricts in bright light to allow less light in so it’s easier to see contrast in bright light. Conversely, the pupil opens up in darkness to allow more light in. Additionally, the rods and cones that are what detect the light entering the eye. As the ambient brightness increases,they grow less sensitive and in darkness, they are more sensitive. Simply put, this is because as the light level increases, the rods and cones will send a weaker signal to the brain telling you that they just detected a particle of light. You may notice it takes about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the darkness when going from a brightly lit area to outside at night. These are evolutionary adaptions that allow humans to see well in varying levels of ambient light.",838
t3_ncj391,How do you properly deal with a loss of a pet?,gy5am89,"Physically I think similarly to any other lost loved one and to whatever extent helps you emotionally to start the honouring and grieving process.

If you think about it people who are really close to their pets have a very deep connection. There is often more physical contact than there is with human loved ones. There is also a bond built in learning how to communicate without the language and communication styles that we're used to. All of this requires significant attention and connection and for many people, especially those who are emotionally sensitive (which I personally think is a strength) a very rich relationship forms. Overall: Breathe, allow feelings to surface, go through the stages of grief and know that you were both better for knowing each other. I hope this helps.",931

I went full tilt when I wrote it. Now, it's important to note that I had a strong sense of the main character before I even started. I wrote down some bullet point notes, character names, name of the city, setting, and that's about it. From there, I set out a small goal for my character. Step 1 (chapter 1) start his first day as a detective. That was it. I had absolutely no idea where the story was going. I just knew what the first step was. From that first chapter and the events that unfolded within, I figured out the next chapter, and then the next, and the next. What really helped me to stay focused throughout the entire writing process was thematically appropriate background music. I listened to Jazz Noir. My novel series is based on a detective in a noir-ish era fantasy city. That music kept my head in the theme and in the story. I just finished writing book 2 and it's currently going through beta readers. That book was also written with that same music in my ears. Seeing as how I've gone and turned myself into a mystery / crime novelist, I have now set out the goal of building each novel around a case.

t3_ne2lmg,How do I have fun writing by myself?,gyegdqx,"As an avid roleplayer, I've done a lot of ~collaborative writing~ in my time. I guess I'll chime in. I totally understand where you're coming from, because there tends to be an unpredictable aspect to not being in control of one (r more) characters in a scene. You can then bounce off the energy one another brings and when it's good, you and your writing partner are drumming up what feels like a really awesome story. However, alone you don't got that bouncing back and forth. You're the only one in charge of where the scene goes. When you're trying to write out an interaction it feels flat since you're in control of both sides. I've done both solo and collaborative writing. I would say my solo work is totally different than what I write with other people, it's kind of hard to replicate. What I can say is what I've found that helps that bounce is writing all my dialogue out first, maybe a few lines of action if needed to give a sketch of the scene. What could also help is try and write as if you are you and your writing partner. Write a block from one character's pov, actions, dialogue and then respond to it from the other character's. And then you can go through and fix things up, flesh things out, fix the POV to whatever format you're intending to complete the story in. Just an idea! I hope you figure out a way to enjoyably write solo. I understand how difficult it is when you're used to collaborating with someone else (I often called it 'junk food' writing since it can get so addictive but never really satisfied my own writing goals)",1559

If you had a drink that was 70 degrees inside a room where the air was 70 degrees they would both just stay 70 degrees. If the drink was hotter than the air it would it would transfer its heat to the air and become cooler. If the drink was colder than the air, the air would transfer it's heat to the drink and the drink would become warmer. If you could suck all the air out of a room the drink would just stay the same temperature since nothing is taking it's heat away or adding to it (not entirely true). A lot of mugs actually have an inner wall and outer wall with a vacuum in-between to create this effect. Now obviously the inner wall is connected to the outer wall at some point to hold the mug together. Additionally things will radiate heat even if they're not coming into direct contact with anything. So mugs won't keep things hot (or cold) forever, but it can last a while.",961

t3_ngeyjh,viltrumites physicology. I'm really confused on something's?,gyqlxl7,"No idea on 1. On 2, basically the Viltrumite genes are almost all dominant. So mark has a bunch of human genes, but they act like recessive genes - garbage information that ends up not being used by cells as blueprints to build his physiology. An example of how this works in humans is right handedness. Breed a left handed human with a right handed human and the resulting offspring will be 85-90% right handed. His cells have human information coded in their DNA but it's not expressed. Expression being key here - mark was human until he hit a certain age, then bam, viltrumite genes kick in and his physiology changes. That's why no matter what you breed viltrumites with, the children will reach maturity then take a hard turn to viltrumite - when they do, at all. Nolan did say he was waiting for mark to develop powers OR NOT. That was always a chance. Because Mark is not pure viltrumite, he will not live as long as Nolan. But half if infinity is still infinity. Purebred viltrumites live for many thousands of years. How many thousands? We don't know. We do know the guy that fathered one person who was already much older than Nolan, the guy that originated the Viltrumite empire, was still alive in the present, so make of that what you will.",1254

Having the bare minimum is so much better than having nothing. I grew up poor AF but never really knew it because even though we were eating hotdogs and rice or spaghetti everyday I had something to eat when my friends didn’t. Hold on to hope and treat every day’s meal as a gift. Any kind of chicken casserole is dope in my book (boxed or made from scratch, frozen veggies are cheaper and healthier that canned stuff usually, eggs can feed you for any meal anytime, breakfast for dinner can be fun instead of necessary, try to plan out a menu for the week and do your shopping in one trip instead of multiple trips (this saves me hella money). Also water is really filling after a small meal and can keep you feeling satisfied for a lot longer so make sure you’re hydrating after eating! For fun we would go on walks, go to the park with pbj’s, go to the bookstore or library, walk around the mall with a tiny budget for an item or two, cloud watch, arts and crafts like making a collage with magazines and glue, make cooking a family affair, share and do self care things like grooming/laundry/nails/face care, cheap squirt guns are hours of fun from the dollar store, participate in community events like going to a farmers market (tasty samples), youth volunteers usually take parents for their programs and sometimes they even have snacks depending on the program.

It's really a lot like that. Normally when you sell or buy stock, the exchange of money for stock happens at approx. the same time. Shorting stock is almost always referring to ""selling short"", which is, literally, ""I will give you this many stock shares at future time T, if you give me _now_ what they're worth now"". With the presumption that the price will go DOWN before T, so that you can buy that many shares just in time, paying less than you already got from selling them. This gets you in trouble if the price, instead, goes UP, and you don't already have enough shares to pass on ... and, since there's technically no limit on HOW high a stock's price can go, you may end up in REAL trouble if you find either that you now can't afford to buy enough shares ... or if there AREN'T enough shares available to buy, at any price, because others are holding on to theirs to see how high it'll go. ""Buying short"" and ""buying/selling long"" also exist, with appropriate differences between time money changes hands and time stocks transfer. But those three don't run the same risks, if you analyze them. --Dave, and computerized millisecond-timing stock-trading agents make this all GREATLY difficult for single unassisted people to make money off of, unless things happen that defy the predicting models, like the recent reddit/Gamestop foofaraw.",1442

t3_nh2jdd,Are fake ghosts too ScoobyDoo?,gytx13v,"It comes off as more campy, it’s often treated as a trope for kids shows, but I don’t think it’s wrong to use the idea. And if we avoided common tropes that showed up in books or TV shows, there would be nothing we could really write about. Science-fiction couldn’t use Warriors space races because we’ve seen them with Klingons, Fantasy couldn’t use the elegant elf or the stoic dwarf. The femme fatales of mystery would be no more. We should avoid using tired tropes the same way they’ve always been used, the reader just stops caring after a while and it loses its original meaning, the same way that certain figures of speech have kind of lost their unique edge. However, just because Scooby Doo did it, doesn’t mean it can’t be done and done so in a unique way that readers enjoy. My worry would be less so about the tropes and more so about your personal doubt of the story. If you doubt the story as the author, my fear would be some of that doubt seeping in to the story itself. If you feel the story doesn’t work for some reason, you need to look at your world and figure out if it plays buy a set of rules that you can understand and make sense. I think there’s a good chance you’re just being hard on yourself because you don’t want this to be compared to Scooby Doo and this is something we saw a lot growing up, but I personally think the idea can work if you handle it correctly. Scooby Doo treated it as a child’s cartoon, you were the potential of treating it as something a little more grown-up and therefore it’s different enough that I don’t think there’s much of a problem.",1593

t3_nijch2,What is the difference between mathematics and metaphysics in Kant?,gz2flbb,"Kant's rejection of metaphysics as science comes from his distinction between the phenomenal and the noumenal. The noumenal is the ""truest"" reality, or that which exists independent of the mind. By virtue of existing independent of the mind, it is impossible to know anything about the noumenal world. So, questions of God or of reality that go beyond the purview of our experience can never be proven either way. Kant does, however, argue that metaphysics has a purpose in the phenomenal world (the world that we **do** experience. The phenomenal is dictated by what **synthetic a priori functions.** These are the faculties of intuition, understanding, and reason. According to Kant, these faculties exist in every rational being. Because of this, it is actually possible to make demonstrative claims about the phenomenal world. So, metaphysics is much better as a **critical philosophy.** It's better at teaching us what we don't know, rather than what we do know. Mathematics (because it is found through reason, intuition, understanding) is possible as a science in the phenomenal world. It operates within a constant set of principles; principles necessary to the phenomenal world. Metaphysics as a science is impossible because it's trying to make claims about the noumenal world, which is impossible. Simply put, mathematics is possible because it operates solely in the phenomenal world and is consistent with synthetic a priori concepts. *\*Edit: I should qualify this by saying that I am by no means an expert on Kant, although I have read Critique of Pure Reason and the Prolegomena.*",1596
t3_nj1s2g,"I’ve never been on a plane, and barely been inside an airport, but now I am about to start flying at least every 6-8 weeks. Is there anything I should know?",gz4zahd,"Well done for doing something new like this OP. If you’re travelling with big bags, you’ll be dropping them off first. They’ll weigh them at the baggage counter (usually well signposted or close to the doors) and away they go. Then you’ll go through security. This is just where they’ll check your smaller suitcase, make you go through a metal detector (or scanner) and assess whether or not they need to test anything for anything. A lot of the time, you have to take large electronics out of your suitcase and put them on a tray on their own. You won’t be able to take large liquids through and all of your small liquids should be in a clear plastic bag out of your suitcase. You might get patted down after you go through the metal detector, you might not. Once all is well, you go down a very clever path that usually takes you past shops and places to eat, depending on the size of the airport. Your gate should be clearly signposted so that you know where you’re going, but people will be happy to help if you ask. You usually show your passport before boarding if you’re flying international and you should have your boarding pass ready. You board the plane, pop your small case in an overhead locker, any smaller bags can usually go under the seat in front of you. Keep your tray up where it is for takeoff. Usually the people working onboard will do a safety demonstration as the plane is being taxied to the runway. This is all normal and something done on every flight. The setting off can be a little fast on the ground, especially if the runway is bumpy. But, it’s usually over and done very quickly because the plane is much smoother as it lifts, it then doesn’t feel quite so fast. There can occasionally be a lot of turbulence when taking off so I would expect some shaking just to be safe. Sometimes it can be bumpy. Up at altitude, it’s often much smoother with pockets of turbulence. Try not to let these worry you. I’m terrified of flying and a travel blogger so I completely understand if they do, but nothing bad will happen because of them and pilots will often talk to each other about bad pockets to try avoid them.

t3_nj3yho,What job do you think an incel would be great at?,gz57rcv,"The problem is, basically none of the traits that incels are associated with, either intentionally or not, are desirable for a work environment. Right off the bat, blaming other people for your problems? No one wants to work with that guy, much less train them. Being instantly hostile toward half your customers? Also not great. Completely lack of persistence, and also social skills? Just not a good look. There's a joke answer of something like saying ""Oh, they could make good firewatch rangers because they're used to being alone all the time!"" I guess? But even then, you're trusting someone who presents as actively belligerent toward other people, to warn other people of impending danger. I wouldn't trust an incel with that job.

t3_nj3x4r,Do writing aids such as Autocrit/ProWritingAid hurt our collective efforts?,gz5amr1,"Thinking these programs are basically advanced spellcheckers is a misunderstanding of what they do. The scores reflect how well the books conform to current publishing averages. Lovecraft and the others don't score well because they use outdated English. Run ProWritingAid again in fifty years and those with top marks today will have plummeted. A human editor will correct toward industry norms in the same way, it's their job to make your text publisher friendly. Besides spelling and grammar, these programs recognize patterns and compare them to literary sources. Industry standards is set as default, if you want to compare your writing to Lovecraft you can, it's just a matter of checking the right box, he's included as a template. Besides, if you work with one of these programs you quickly realise there's no way to fix everything they flag, and they're not telling you to either. They just report on things that are known issues and give you the opportunity to make a decision. They have no opinions what so ever on content, thank the stars.",1051
t3_nj3wqi,[Harry Potter] Why was Slytherin house not discontinued after Salazar left the school and was kinda sorta evil?,gz697sj,"I think the way Slytherin house was portrayed in the books was quite thin. I always got the impression the house was meant to be for those who possess cunning and therefore are not inherently evil. That said, that's just my head cannon. Another head cannon explanation that is actually supported by the books (although Chamber of Secrets contradicts it) is that students are sorted in to houses based on their most prominent character trait, e.g Gryffindors are courageous. If they were to remove Slytherin, it could potentially exclude hundreds of students who don't fit the requirements of the other three houses. Then again, if this is true, you have to wonder if there are other potential students going uneducated because they don't fit with the 4 main houses.

t3_njnmvz,What is happening when you’re loading a new browser window on your phone and it refreshes a bunch of times?,gz8ery9,"This is probably due to buffering. Buffering in few words is your computer receiving and processing data from servers so you can visualize the web pages in your screen. Obviously the server will be sending and receiving the data from your computer so it will need to refresh over and over again until you computer have processed all the information needed to let you visualize the webpage. (it will need to refresh because pages are static, they cannot change in real time but they can get updates, when the page updates it will need to refresh to show you the actual thing.) That's also the reason why slower connections means slower loading times, your computer needs to download all the data before showing you the page. Just like you would download anything. Like, you cannot play a song without having it saved somewhere. You need to download it first and then you can listen to it. Is exactly the same thing with pages. The only difference is that when you make a change (send data) in the page or the page needs to show additional information (receive data), it will need to download more data and refresh the page.",1122

t3_nk882s,"What was your ""Wow! That worked?"" moment?",gzbgh6f,"Whilst working on my lab project I had a lab day that was pretty much a cascade of problems and difficulties from start to finish. Skipping over most of it, I was at the point where I needed to evaporate my samples, I specifically requested a tank of nitrogen for this and one was set up for me in the morning. I didn’t get to it until the evening, and some fuckwit decided they were gonna use the whole tank and then leave it. At this time of the evening the technical staff who have access to more tanks and stuff like it had long since gone home so I couldn’t get a new one, and I couldn’t leave my sample either, cus if they didn’t get evaporated and reconstituted, then they’d expire. I could not let this happen, those samples were taken at a specific date I’d outlined in my methodology, and I only had the ones I’d grabbed on that day. So I needed a solution really quick with whatever the lab had to hand. This was for me to set the samples in some test tubes, precariously balance them in a beaker, and put that beaker in a heat bath. After about half an hour of me staring intently at the bath, to see if the samples had f i n a l l y evaporated, and to make sure they didn’t fall over and lose my samples forever, they actually did evaporate. To this day it still stuns me that actually worked",1305
t3_nk990a,ELI5 What is a logarithmic scale? Why is it more useful for some things than a regular numerical scale?,gzbng1b,"Imagine you wanted to plot the net worth of people in your area in a graph that shows all the data. Now most of the net worth will be around the lower end with some higher in between. So you can nicely see how the worth is distributed among the people. Then suddenly Elon Musk decides to join your area. Now your nice graph is screwed. Why is it screwed? Because the number line that previously was at let's say 500k max suddenly jumped to 147 billion. So the graph, as it is supposed to show all points, now is squished such that Elon Musk is at the top, a single outlier in the whole distribution. Even the richest guy in your area before is a measly 0.00034% on the scale. (Yes that's right, those are 3 zeros after the decimal AND it's percent. That is how laughable 500k are in that distribution) This makes it impossible to see any difference between the 500k guy and the 300k guy the 30k guy and so on. They're all down in the same line from Elons perspective. So now you take a logarithmic scale, meaning you take their net worth, throw it into a logarithmic function and then plot that value. You obviously have to adjust the y axis accordingly. The 30k guy is now a 4.47. The 200k guy is now a 5.3. The 500k guy is now a 5.7. And Elon? Well he's an 11.17. These now fit on a single graph and you can still make out differences between the ""smaller"" numbers. Logarithmic scales are generally often used when exponential growth is concerned, like population growth, spreading of diseases. Also when you have to work with data that spans a huge range of values, like comparing the size of objects in the universe. Using logarithmic scales and transformations is very common in machine learning and data science.",1718

t3_nk9m52,"Neurotypical Children of Autistic/Special Needs Parents, what was your childhood like? What is your current relationship with them? And finally, if you had the choice, would you want different parents?",gzcc59m,"My mother is autistic, she's in her 70s and was diagnosed as an adult as it wasn't really a thing when she was a child. Her behaviour caused my father to leave when I was very young, leaving her raising 3 kids alone. She doesn't really understand jokes or sarcasm, so you have to be careful how you phrase things as she'll take most things literally. Any change to routine is a struggle, which meant I always had very strict rules about where I could go, how long I could stay out for etc. For example, if I was visiting a friend, I couldn't call her and ask to sleep over, as that wasn't The Plan. My friends always thought she was great; she always fed people, made a big fuss on birthdays etc, but it was because she had taught herself certain social cues and expectations. When it was just family she was completely different and usually closed off. She also doesn't like any music. At all. She says it's just irritating noise, so I got used to wearing headphones a lot. The hardest part was that if anyone upset her (regardless of intention), she would just... stop talking to everyone for days at a time. When I was little she would keep making meals, doing chores, bedtimes etc, all just in silence. I'm in my 30s now, and we've got a really good relationship. I don't visit her often but we talk 3-4 times a week. When I was growing up I remember crying myself to sleep and wishing for a different mummy, but now I understand her better, I think she did the best she could raising us. One of my nephews is autistic, and I think its helped her having someone she can relate to a bit more.",1595

Even if you’re super attractive and charming, sometimes in that environment that’s the last thing on someone’s mind, but still you didn’t even do anything wrong. That encounter couldn’t really have been drawn out without risking her getting uncomfortable or something or you saying something actually cringe worthy. I’m not the smoothest guy but for me I basically “fake it till’ I make it”, which is just me being overtly confident. I get some sort of facade over me and just speak to girls and anyone as if it’s nothing. I’m not saying this is the foolproof strategy, as it may just work for me, but I think having some misplaced confidence can go a long way. Again, probably not the best idea to be talking up people at their jobs, but in this case you kept it short and it was nothing wrong, and who knows, maybe after enough conversations, you can ask her out. Doesn’t matter if she says yes or no, it’s just about taking that chance, and if she says no, you move onto the next person, easy.

t3_nmvkdn,ELI5: Why is Iron the boundary between nuclear fusion and fission. What makes it so unique?,gzr7i71,"That has got to do with the binding energy of the core. Now what is binding energy? It's essentially the energy that you need to break a core apart. Now why is that important, well one could assume that the weight of a core is the same as the sum of weights of it's consituent parts, but it isn't. The core is usually lighter than the sum of it's parts, which is call mass defect. Now according to Einstein and his famous formula E=mc², mass (m) and energy (E) are directly related through a constant (c=speed of light), so you essentially a difference in energy between the core and what you'd get if you break it apart. Which is aptly called the ""binding energy"". So it's essentially the energy that you get by having a core over having parts. Meaning the creation of the core released energy and to break apart the core you'd need to resupply it with energy. So if you look at the graph displaying the binding energy of cores per nucleon (parts of the core), you'll find this: https://opentextbc.ca/universityphysicsv3openstax/chapter/nuclear-binding-energy/ So if you take 2 hydrogen atoms (consisting of a proton and a neutron) with a binding energy of ~1MeV per nucleon and fuse them to make helium (consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons or the the stuff in 2 hydrogens) then you realize that you went from 1MeV/nucleon for ²H to 7MeV per nucleon for ⁴He. So you start from 4 nucleons at 1MeV = 4MeV to 4 nucleons at 7MeV = 28MeV now removing the 4MeV to break up the hydrogens you get 24MeV of energy from that reaction. Consersely if you break idk U235 into Ba142 and Kr91 the difference is much smaller let's say U235 are very roughly around ~7.5MeV and the other two are very roughly ~8.5MeV than you'd get a ~1MeV per nucleon which sounds like way less but you'd get that 235 times. So as long as the result of either fusion or fission ends up having a higher binding energy than the stuff you fused or broke apart you would gain the difference in binding energy. However if you look closely iron is the core with the highest binding energy so both fusion and fission would require not provide you with energy.",2122

But this idea of desire as productive force is something very much in line with Deleuze's poststructural way of thinking, so that you can't really say ""A desires B"" as if desire was a relation between two separate, static subjects. It's more like that when A desires B, B gets constituted in this process, same as this desiring also transforms A. It's not like ""A produces an image of B"" - that's not what ""productive"" means for Deleuze (and Guattari) and that's why he's talking about ""reality"". In desiring A as well as B get transformed and bcome something other. Furthermore, one thing Deleuze emphasizes often is that you don't usually desire a specific thing, but a ""assamblage"" - meaning that what A desires in B is a manifoldness of processes (things that A associates with B for example). I'm not sure how this relates to the idea of productive force in Deleuze, but it should also relate to this non-structuralist idea.",1038
t3_nmw8cg,For extremely nice people who snapped what’s your story?,gzqzyoz,"My ""snap"" turned into a whole phase. I was \*that\* girl in school. The nice helpful one, the teachers pet, the person you can borrow things from, take things from even without permission. I was nice. You could say there wasn't any single specific thing that made me snap, it was a multitude of things that became the last straw at some point. Learning about societal injustices, bigotry, people abusing my niceness, being bullied or talked down to for being nice, people being sucky, the pressure of being nice, pressure of being a good student, pressure to not become a disappointment, you get my point. I turned full on hostile. I'm talking about mean, blunt, no-f's-given, if I don't like you, you would know and I'm not going to try and hide it, kind of hostile. In a way, I was a b\*tch, It's been a few years now, I've internalized a lot of things, became a bit more mature and I'm almost over that hostile phase.

With the possible exceptions of electricity and the internal combustion engine, I don't think the world has ever witnessed such fast-paced development and adaptation of technology with such massive consequences for both our working lives and day-to-day living: last night I summoned food to my doorstep with the same rectangle I'm holding in my hand to type this comment. For my generation and younger ones, this rapid change is normal. Think about the fact that it's normal for us to watch a piece of technology become obsolete half-a-decade after its invention. I have never owned anything on Blu-ray. I went from VHS to DVD to pirating to streaming. I skipped an entire invention and barely noticed. But all this change is becoming exhausting. I don't want to ever have to learn a new OS. I hate that so much software requires its own app or account (for data mining.) I'm having to constantly Google 'How to...' to trouble-shoot a device or learn my way around an app that's suddenly become essential for online teaching. And then the app gets an update and all the settings are in the wrong place and its background is now yellow.

Lacking nutrients is an example of such a state of potential harm. A state of irritation is a state where the life-form is energized to act in certain ways (e.g. foraging for food, escaping a hostile situation) which are likely to reduce or avoid the potential harm. By contrast, a state of quiescence or passivity is a state where the life-form is ""de-energised"". It comes about as a reflex reaction to certain conditions in which being quiet, still and/or saving energy tend to reduce or avoid the potential harm. Sadly the reflex behaviors of humans are often not well-tuned to their modern societal environment and this often leads to negative outcomes. For example, getting irrtated at, and abusive to, the staff in a restaurant generally does not mean that your hunger will be satisfied more quickly.

You don't get good at writing without actually writing. A *lot*. I've heard ""five million words"" thrown about as a figure but I suspect this differs for everyone. Writing is a skill.

This does not include businesses that are taking tens of kilowatts or industries measuring their draw sometimes in several megawatts or more, just homes. Since there's 22 million strikes a year and we need over 900 million just to power *just* the homes, it's already looking pretty grim in terms of cost to benefit. This is assuming we manage to capture every strike (even more expensive) and that weather plays in our favor.

t3_n4mrt1,How do we know the truth or falsity of synthetic a priori propositions according to Kant?,gwwizky,"By synthetic a priori, Kant is usually talking about mathematics (arithmetic and geometry). Kant thinks we can know them because we have a priori categories of understanding and spatio-temporal form of intuition (and pure intuition) to structure and condition our experience. We can know them because, in a rough sense, they ""come from us"". For Kant, a successful mathematical reasoner can know the truths of arithmetic and geometry by constructing the associated concepts through intuitions. This is how Burge describes it: &gt; I shall, however, sketch my view of it. Kant takes pure intuition in geometry to be intuitions of determinate objects. The objects of intuition are particulars, such as line-drawings, or even possible line-drawings, in pure geometrical intuition—pure imagination. (They can also be intuited in em- pirical intuition, on paper; but only non-empirical formal aspects of the empirical intuition play any role in mathematical understanding, reasoning, and justification.) From these objects one abstracts objects of a more general kind—‘the triangle’, for example—which are the objects of mathematical reasoning. 45 These latter objects are forms within the structure of space or time—on Kant’s idealist view, forms of spatio-temporal intuition itself. https://philosophy.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Burge-2000-Frege-on-Apriority.pdf &gt; synthetic propositions typically true based on their conformity to the world For Kant, analytic truths are truths about identity statements which are only good for clarification (they say nothing new but clarify what's already known within the concepts under use). The analytic propositions (Kant's version), also, usually involve some ""concept-containment"" (for example the predicate may be contained in the subject). Synthetic propositions are basically negation of all that. It says some new things instead of just expanding what's contained in a concept. So for example, that ""12"" is a result of adding ""5"" and ""7"", is synthetic because 12 is neither contained in the concept of 5, 7, or addition (+). 12 is a product of synthesizing them. So it's not necessarily just about ""conformity"" to the world (in some sense even analytic statements can be said to ""conform""). Note: analytic-synthetic division is contentious and a very messy topic. Different aspects of Kantian style of analyticity vs synthetic have been under attack by a lot of later philosophers for the right or wrong reasons. Disclaimer: I am not an expert (or anything close). However, I had a course recently on a related topic.",2571

t3_n4o3rs,What scandalous thing did you see that you were not supposed to see?,gwwl70i,"Not that crazy, but an old job that provided pretty much limitless stories. Was at a nursery (wholesale plants and shit). I guess the last and biggest one was right before I left (for this reason, among others). One of the owners had been sleeping with an employee off and on. That employee was married at the time, and her husband worked there as well. Not only that, but her husband effectively built the place with his own two hands. Dude was a very skilled mechanic/maintenance dude, pretty much did everything and everything, and was a large reason the business was successful (they wouldn't be able to afford having contractors come out and do it ""by the books"". Not only that, but the husband drove CDL for them, risking a lot because he hasn't had his DOT physical in forever either, so he had to dodge around the backroads, hoping to never be in an accident or run into an unexpected weigh station. Best part? The owner would go over to their house and literally eat this mans food in front of him, knowing he was fucking his wife. If this were to get out, it'd do a lot of damage, as a lot of people were confused as to what she even did there, and they knew there was some hard favoritism involved in her keeping her job. Best part? The friend who told me about this is now dating the owner. Not only that, the owners more than 20 years older than her. As I told her would happen, she was made a manager and got a decent raise within a couple months of dating him. That's just one story of many I've had from that place, many of which dealt with workers rights and other legal issues they attempt to skate around. Sadly both owners have zero experience running a business, no education or anything in that matter. Not only that, but they weren't exactly educated or experienced in the business/work involved either, which made for a LOT of having to redo work, or wasted money.",1888

She never paid the rent we agreed on and stole from me (owes me $1200 still). Then when I lost my patience after she date-raped me and kicked her out, I found that she had completely ruined my bed by hiding ""ash trays"" (my stainless steel measuring cups) between the mattress and the box springs with burn marks to indicate they weren't always out when she stuffed them there (which I don't get because we had a nice balcony and there was no need to smoke inside), and she had trash piled a foot high against the walls all around the room which she'd covered with her clothes (I stuffed all of it in one bag and made her take her trash with ger clothes). Then, I learned she had been spreading rumors to my neighbors that I was sexually assaulting her and abusing my puppy (I assume for something dramatic to gossip about).

After seeing my mother we had a pretty weird conversation and we roamed around together for a bit and came back home. If I talk about day to day stuff, then I usually call my boyfriend and rant to him. If talking takes up more energy, I text him about it.

In such cases i always let the character lead me. Whether it's a happy, tragic or open ending, the more important thing is that the end must completely a cycle for each character. Readers are waiting to see whether each character arc has fulfilled their purpose in the story. It also has to be symbolic to where they began. Depending on characters they also much have come a ways from where they began. Personal development. If you're writing a negetive arc for a character then hitting all the stages of descent into the dark side is important. I do agree that in these uncertain times a happy ending would be good for readers. But I'd say for me personally as long as the character arc can unlock all of it's potential, as long as readers get to see that. Any ending is good.",875

Currently at 195k. &amp;#x200B; Another superb video game music channel that has a smaller amount of subs is Dr. Pez, only has 61K subs yet has the absolute best Pokémon Sapphire/Ruby medley in existence with collaborators. Beautiful medley I often listen too. Also has other musical video game related videos. &amp;#x200B; Not very small but if you're into tech, Optimum Tech makes incredible videos on ITX computer builds, water cooling, mice etc. Sets itself apart from bigger channels like LTT by being a bit more serious and to the point, and ofcourse the big focus on ITX. &amp;#x200B; If you like Super Marios Bros. 3 in particular, MitchFlowerPower is hands down one of the absolute best, uploads world records and attempts that came close, also does romhacks. Only 25K, crazy. &amp;#x200B; If you're into emulation, most notably for Wii U and Switch, BSoD Gaming is amazing resource on all things surrounding CEMU, Yuzu and Ryujinx. Sometimes branches out into Xenia or RPCS3 aswell. Currently at 179K &amp;#x200B; Also not very small with almost 400K subs is False Swipe Gaming, if you're a Pokémon nerd you'll like these in-depth looks into the competitive viability of Pokémon. &amp;#x200B; Matt McMuscles with 372K has great documentary type video content about rough development cycles of games, also does some let's plays but I'm personally not into those. &amp;#x200B; Coppersan is my go to for Maplestory content, I sometimes like to indulge in the nostalgia or the mindless grind that is Maplestory nowadays and Coppersan makes entertaining and informative videos. Only got 68K, which to be fair, is probably more than the amount of people still playing MS lmao. &amp;#x200B; Prod is a Let's Player with mainly Dark Souls content, but I find him extremely funny and he's one of my favorite youtubers. Currently at 396k subs. &amp;#x200B; Lastly, Totally Not Mark, with nearly 600k subs is easily the biggest channel in this list. He used to focus mainly on Dragonball discussions and reviews of arcs, in-depth storytelling and strcutures but has recently started blind-reviewing other Anime like One Piece, HxH and Attack on Titan.

t3_n6g89y,"What is flight response trauma, and flight response anxiety?",gx6xfq2,"There are four main responses to danger in living things: fight, flight, freeze and fawn. Kids who have traumatic upbringings tend to figure out fast which of these is going to work most often in their environment. So if you had a traumatic upbringing, whichever of these consistently worked for you in childhood has the potential to get ""stuck"" as a core way that you interact with the world. The flight response is simple, it's an urge to get away from the stressor. If flight consistently worked for you in childhood, then in adulthood, that might manifest as things like leaving relationships or workplaces as soon as there's an issue, never addressing growing problems, or jittery energy that keeps you compulsively doing things all day with an inability to relax. I'm recalling this off the top of my head from Pete Walker's book on Complex PTSD so if you want a deep dive, do check that out.",898

I went down to the cafeteria and bought myself an apple juice and grabbed one of those little free plastic cups for water. I poured just a little bit of juice in there, and returned to the classroom. I stopped in front of his desk, and said ""hey, do you want a NEW (my name) pee story?"" And I threw the juice in his face.

As the snake grew larger, it displayed interesting behavior at night. While it used to sleep curled or wrapped up, it started to move around and sleep vertically, like us. The owners were worried and went to the vet and explained the odd behavior. The vet asked “where is the snake now? You need to get it out of your apartment - he is sizing you up to see if you can fit in his body”. They were clearly spooked and thank god they went to the vet when they did. They probably had 1-2 weeks before the snake became big enough. To answer OP seriously, I sleep pretty long. Temperpedic is worth the purchase.",856

Stark's ""Titanium-Gold"" alloy he uses no one knows it's per capita kg price. CNC machine Stark already had. Bear in mind Mark III suit was fabricated in Stark's House at home in less than a day.

Sadly in the UK there is no easy way for be to try before I buy. There are some office liquidation companies I can buy a second-hand one from at significant saving though. Also of concern is confirmation bias in reviews.

t3_n9pit6,[Marvel Comics] Why does Thor wield a magical hammer that grants people the power of Thor?,gxp4z2j,"&gt;Why not find a weaker being who is worthy and give them the powerful weapon so that there are actually more worthy Thor-tier beings in the universe? See Thunderstrike and his son, who is also now Thunderstrike. Mjolnir in fairness is a convoluted mess that keeps getting retconned into different things. Iconic story is that Odin placed the Worthiness Enchantment on it while robbing Thor of his powers - basically sealing the powers of Thor in the Mjolnir. In this setup anyone who is worthy would literally wield the powers of Thor, while Thor himself doesn't have any of his powers. I don't actually know at what point this stopped being the case - I think it was during one of Thor dying/resurrecting events where he kept all his divine powers even without Mjolnir. The enchantment stayed however, so anyone worthy would still gain powers of Thor. Most of the magical duplicates of Mjolnir, like Stormbreaker axe and Thunderstrike mace were created back when Thor still depended on Mjolnir for his powers, so they were forged to keep more Thor-tier dudes in game. In addition: Where it gets complicated is in current year, I think with Jason Aaron run, although it might have been introduced earlier when there were plots about young Thor - because apparently now Mjolnir is somehow almost sentient weapon and worthiness enchantment doesn't work anymore and the mallet itself decides who it wants to wield it - which is how we got Jane Foster Thor. Also it apparently has some sort of cosmic storm sealed in it, instead of powers of Thor. Also Mjolnir was destroyed and reforged before and after that revelation on separate occasions, so who the hell even knows nowadays what's the deal with the Worthiness Enchantment and the Power of Thor.",1749

Let's assume that several people in town think it's a problem and wish it was fixed (notice choice of wording): * Repairing the bridge costs money and resources that the town may or may not have. * Repairing the bridge technically falls into the hand of the governing body (or even private ownership), the latter might be unwilling to invest money in repairing the bridge (due to various reasons). * Due to the above problem - repairing the bridge might involve a use of force and/or long legal battles that the town's people might not wish to have. * Repairing the bridge might demand a consencus amongst the majority of the town's people. In that case some of the towns people might not be aware the bridge needs repair or are even oppossed to repairing it (sometimes for good reasons). * Some people don't even believe there's a bridge: ""There is no bridge, it's all just a \[insert hated group here\] conspiracy"". Followed up by a lynch. * There is actually no bridge or no problem with the bridge. It literally was just the mayor making campaign noises to avoid other (more difficult) issues in the town.

t3_n9rgb7,The diminishment of aesthetic experience with repeated exposure?,gxqq2uc,"I think there's the question of whether aesthetic pleasure is derived from the experience of some ideal (i.e., a timeless beauty), or whether aesthetic pleasure is fundamentally relational and for instance contingent on the evocation of 'exteriority' (i.e., the unheard-of, the novel) within the viewer. In a certain model, the 'uncanniness' of the work of art would be an essential feature: its capacity to simultaneously exhibit exteriority (and, at bottom, an absence of meaning, the sterility which is proper to art and form) whilst also mitigating resistance to that experience of 'uncanniness' or exteriority or meaninglessness and 'smuggling it' into the viewer through the use of formal effects, which would in a certain sense be secondary. If this is the case, aesthetic pleasure would be fundamentally contingent on the 'uncanniness' (i.e., the novelty) it evokes in a viewer and the frisson generated by the interplay of that experience of uncanniness and its dissimulation through formal effects. As the novelty would be diminished with repeat viewings, the specifically aesthetic nature of this pleasure would over time give way to something more one sided (i.e., the pleasure evoked by the formal effects in themselves). Hope this makes sense / is useful rather than just being word salad -- slightly rushed lol, and trying to communicate without using psychoanalytic jargon. this is largely based on the conception of art set out by Sarah Kofman in books like The Childhood of Art: An interpretation of Freud's Aesthetics, Freud and Fiction, Mélancolie de l'art.",1577
t3_n9re8q,ELI5: How does gargling salty warm water relieve sore throat?,gxpeyys,"There are two schools of thought when it comes to why gargling with warm water is relieving to a sore throat, and while some consensus has been reached between them, they still disagree on a number of matters; here's what we *do* know. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Warm water can help relax and soothe a number of the involuntary muscles and tissue that surround your pharynx (throat) and larynx (deeper throat). When you have a sore throat, the tissue that lines your throat can become inflamed or swollen, dependent of course on the reason for your sore throat. Gargling with *warm* water, regardless of salt content can help to alleviate some of this inflammation by stimulating vasodilation (blood vessels getting bigger) in the tissue, and relax the smooth muscle (muscle you don't control) around your pharynx and larynx. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Salt helps to stimulate mucosal secretions, and can in fact aide in mucosal secretion. A fundamental precursor to mucosal secretion (the phlegm-y throat you get when you're sick) is the secretion of isotonic fluids (water and salts), that aid mucous secreting cells. When gargling with warm salty water, you are helping in a teeny-tiny fashion to form this isotonic fluid, and thus, helping your body's natural response to infection.",1266

The only raptors that Muldoon encounted were kept in a cage and delivered food. The hunting patterns of dinosaurs are just a huge unknown with almost no comparable animals alive today. Mammal techniques are not the same as bird or reptile techniques. All knowledge of Raptor hunting techniques are merely theoretical and based upon advanced paleontology. Muldoon can read the same sources as Grant, but without the same science background as Grant Muldoon probably can't grasp the why, or understand the potential holes in the conclusions due to limitations of paleontology. Muldoon can only read the conclusion and take it at its word with no understanding of why two different papers might disagree or where the researchers are making assumptions to fill in the gaps of fossil knowledge. Grant however probably wrote some of those papers on raptors and understands the debates and arguments better. Grant knew which pieces of evidence were missing from the papers and thus could quickly change his thinking and reasoning when the missing evidence manifests itself infront of him. Muldoon probably can't. It short, Grant knew the short comings and evidence gaps and could adapt, but Muldoon could only take flawed research as gospel.",1327

If you live on a new me level home and this is a bathroom, take something in the bathroom to cover you from debris but will not suffocate you. 2. Let your loved ones in your family and neighbors or coworkers know your plan. If it is a bad tornado people will need to know where to look for you if it is a shelter, bathroom, or if you opt to always head to your local tornado shelter. 3. Invest in a bugout bag and weather radio to take with you that has some supplies. In case you ever are caught in the center of a tornado you may want a medical kit, water, etc on standby. 4.

Several thinnings take place over that time which can be used for a variety of purposes to help mitigate the costs of management but the final crop can be very high value. The idea is to have enough land under forest cover to be able to harvest some every so often as well as doing thinning work, thus ensuring a regular income as well as a varying aged forest which is good for wildlife, providing ecological services such as water catchment management and the future of the business. Historically most large woodlands in the UK were connected to large estates owned by gentry who took a much longer term view of land management than we do now, so planning for a crop in 150 year made sense as well as ensuring work for people who lived on the estate",870

t3_ndjs2y,How do I stop writing in passive voice?,gybb7u0,"The passive voice is an incredibly useful tool to weave sentences together. What you want to have is a sequence of sentences that flows naturally together. The ending of one presents the opening of the next. Like a camera moving over a scene. Sometimes, you need the passive for that. Dogmatically avoiding the passive would lead to the camera being jerked around all the time instead of moving smoothly over what is happening. To stick to the filming analogy, the cardinal sin of writing is _hiding the actor_. The passive is not a problem _unless_ it hides the actor. If the actor is clearly visible from context, then the passive is perfectly fine and may even present an improvement over a chopped-up sequence of active voice sentences. The dogmatic writing advice to avoid the passive is _wrong_. Even the style guides that are advising this fail to stick to their own dogma. A great talk on the subject: [Linguistics, Style and Writing in the 21st Century - with Steven Pinker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV5J6BfToSw) Pinker pins down the problem that the order of words in a sentence has to do two things at once: - Serve as a code for meaning (who did what to whom) - **Present some bits of information to the reader before others (affects how the information is absorbed)** He uses an example from _Oedipus Rex_ to illustrate the proper use of the passive: &gt; A messenger arrives from Corinth. It emerges that he was formerly a shepherd on Mt. Kithaeron, and during that time **he was given** a baby. The baby, he says, **was given** to him by another shepherd from the Laius household, who **had been told** to get rid of the child. The passive here is essential to properly realize the second task of the order of words: presenting information in the proper order. One sentence moves the camera to the messenger and therefore, the next sentence should start with the messenger. Then, the camera is moved to the baby and therefore, the next sentence should start with the baby and so forth. Attempting to rewrite that scene into a sequence of active voice sentences would jerk the camera all over the place. Quote from the talk's [slide at 31:25](https://youtu.be/OV5J6BfToSw?t=1885): ""Good writers narrate a story, advanced by protagonists who make things happen."" *EDIT* The rest of the slide may explain why some people overuse the passive: &gt; **Why is the Passive So Common in Bad Writing?** &gt; &gt; - Good writers narrate a story, advanced by protagonists who make things happen &gt; - Bad writers work backwards from their own knowledge, writing down ideas in the order in which they occur to them. &gt; - They begin with the _outcome_ of an event, and then throw in the _cause_ as an afterthought. &gt; - The passive makes that easy.",2761

She demanded that I sit down and “take the test,” and I told her that it was already a perfect reflection of what she had taught me. She started screaming at the top of her lungs.

I tried everything with that twat, playing, spanking, psychologically scaring, you know.. all the things parents do but, it just wouldn't budge. That's when i realized, i could read something to her! Telling her a story would surely do the trick, at least that's what i thought but she wasn't buying that Three Little Piggies thing so, i tried to put on that Frozen movie for her but we're poor and don't have Netflix, and that's when i thought, we don't need Netflix, we have YouTube. I typed 'Elsa cartoon show' and put on the first thing that came up and, at the blink of an eye, she was fascinated by it, watched the whole thing and a bunch of other videos afterwards. Hell! She even watched some Mickey mouse show where he and Minnie have a baby, i didn't even know how she searched for that, all i know is that she shut up for awhile and i could enjoy my furry porn in peace without her interrupting me.

If you need to irrigate at all, make sure all the plants in an area in your garden have the same water needs. That area is called a hydrozone. Don't plant a cactus next to a fern, in other words. No one is going to be happy. Plants have seasons and needs.

t3_nfoo2y,eli5 : How did we measure the distance between the sun and the earth?,gymxitv,"The ancient Greeks were the first to measure the distance, and the way they did it was very clever. First, Eratosthenes measured the size of the Earth, which you may have learned about in middle/high school. He knew that on a certain day, the sun would be directly overhead in Egypt... and in Greece he could measure the length of a shadow when the sun was at its highest point. He then used the length of the shadow along with the distance between Egypt and Greece to calculate the circumference of the Earth. Next, the Greek's figured out the size of the moon. They did this during a lunar eclipse, when the Earth cast its shadow on the moon. By measuring the size of Earth's shadow, they could determine the size of the moon. And if you know how big the moon is, and how big it appears, you can calculate how far away it is. The final step is to calculate the distance to the sun. On a perfect half-moon, the Earth, Moon, and Sun form a right triangle (with the 90 degree angle at the half-moon). Now, since you know the distance from the Earth to the moon, you can measure the angle between the sun and the moon, and use a little SOHCAHTOA to calculate the distance from the Earth to the sun. Sadly, this method is not super accurate, but it does give some sort of answer.",1276

He checked maps, even made a phone call to our hotel to locate it, and then sent us on our way to the subway station below for our connecting ride. Really awesome guy :) We still got on the wrong line though.

We don't know how to create it or destroy it, we just know how to transform it. As far as we can tell, this is a limitation of the physics of our universe, not a human/technology problem. So if we're getting energy out of a device it has to be coming \*from\* somewhere and the system you're talking about has no energy input and only a finite amount of energy stored in the magnetic fields. In the particular case of arrangements of permanent magnets, you can always setup an arrangement that applies a \*temporary\* force, but there will \*always\* be a position with no net force. The turbine will rotate until it reaches that point, then stop. That initial rotation is powered by energy in the magnetic field that you put there when you arranged the magnets.

t3_nhng05,What are your thoughts on cryptocurrency and its future ?,gyxa4ka,"Cryptocurrency could have a place, but by far not in its current iteration. The notion of property itself is bound to the state, without a state (or a similar entity) defending your property, it doesn't exist in any meaningful way. You can say you own a house halfway across the country and the goverment makes sure that this property is upheld, without a similar entity, your claims are as valid as your ability to defend them. Thats why in our current situation, there isn't really any use for crypto in that regard. You will still need to get back from the CC economy and connect to the ""regular"" economy to have anything recognized as such. People want CC because ""There is nobody who has control over it"" all the while wanting to live in the same world we now live in, with that entity having control over anything but currency. It's a very narrow minded approach that focuses on one piece of the puzzle as if that could solve anything. Aside from that, CC is currently just really volatile speculation market. If you have money to burn, you can make some more, if you don't, you don't. As there are no real uses for them outside of economies that are down bad at the moment or for illegal activities, it doesn't really serve any real purpose.

t3_nhnkwg,What makes someone's singing more pleasant than others?,gyxaevv,"Some of it is subjective, but all that the tone of any given person's voice (or instrument for that matter) comes down to is the collection of overtones present in their voice. When you sing (or play) ""a note"", the name of that note is just whatever the most prominent tone in your voice is. You're still producing a whole array of other sounds called ""overtones"" along with it. To me, those who have too many high-mid and high frequencies in their voices tend to sound harsh, especially when belting those REALLY high notes. Our ears are more sensitive to frequencies in this range, so that harshness is likely to be a turn-off in more cases when compared with singers who don't have as many of those overtones. Those who sound more balanced, with the right amount of clarity and warmth, often are the ""easiest"" on the ears. That's my theory anyway.",850

Wal Mart managers didn't give a fuck about being helpful that late at night. It was only after 20 minutes of him arguing that a manager finally had to walk back with him to see and 10 minutes later, sure enough, he mis read the price and he didn't want them anymore. We moved on to his other items until it came time to pay. He was paying in three different ways and wanted $10 back on a check or debit card payment. He already gave the cash which was already entered and in the register. Minimum we can give back is $20. He wanted his cash back but I couldn't re-open the register to get the money or reset his balance to 0 without a managers approval.

t3_njajut,Can the method of dialectical materialism explain dialectical materialism's own emergence?,gz6htx0,"&gt;As a philosophy, dialectical materialism's content and conclusions are, according to its own principles, either totally determined or at the very least delimited by the current relations of production. I want to be clear and not misleading. It isn't about prediction and it isn't as if history was an agent apart from human beings. It's about the connection between the thought of an age and it's material base. In that sense, yes, Marxism is explicitly a theory about*capitalism*, concerned with the contradictions within capitalism. By its own understanding, it will fade away, become obsolete in a communist future. Marxism is built upon a critique of capitalist concepts that wouldn't have come to be apart from the rise of a capitalist mode of production, i.e. there would never have been a Marxism in ancient Athens, only in modern Athens. Hegel is not Marx, but he also noted that his thought depended on (was a negation of) Kant, who depended on Hume, etc, each of whom reflected movement in the idea of freedom. Hegel as the negation of the negation, the world process becoming aware of itself, needed those other periods first, as I understand Hegel. Hegel saw his own philosophy as only being possible due to his location in history. This is even more true of Marx. Being moderns ourselves, this seems intuitive, which is kinda the point, i.e. that our own place in history makes this conceptualization intuitive.",1428

t3_nk8xo3,Eli5 how was language first made? How are languages translated?,gzbnq70,"The first languages weren't really 'created' as such. Linguists debate over how exactly they came to be, but it's thought that they evolved over time in order for humans to survive and develop. Humans are naturally social creatures and so would use sounds to communicate. Each sound meant something, whether it was pointing at something, making commands, or using sounds to indicate a feeling. It was all about communicating with other humans, but it was also a means for survival. We don't know exactly when the first languages were created because they don't exactly leave fossils, but its thought anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 years ago languages began. Over time, these sounds became more sophisticated and humans successfully merged grammar systems (also observed in songbirds) and lexical systems (also observed in some primate species that have specific calls for different predators) into what we have today. As for translation, our most important goal is to keep the meaning and 'feel' of the source language in the target language. This requires you to not just be proficient in your 2nd language, but very good at your first language as you're effectively 'co-authoring' for a new audience. For most languages, grammar and sentence structure are very different and you can't just swap out words and call it a day. You also have to take into consideration social/cultural factors. It's not really enough to be able to speak two languages fluently. For example, I translate between Japanese and English. In Japanese, swear words aren't really a thing in the same way they are in English. So when translating a 'vulgar, rude' character to English, using a direct translation may seem too polite for the new audience, and when translating a similar character into Japanese, I might find I have no words to work with and have to rework the sentence! A translator's main goal is always keeping the intended feel of the text (vs. interpretation, which is more about getting the most important info).",2005

t3_nkqsi3,"Christians, what would you do if there was undeniable evidence that God didn't exist?",gzedb7q,"It's extremely difficult to prove a negative. If I make an affirmative claim like ""I have a $20,"" I can produce the $20 and prove that it's true. Proving the nonexistence of gods is like walking up to someone and making the claim that they don't have $20 when you don't know. Maybe they do. Maybe they don't. Maybe they have a combination of bills that make $20, or maybe less or more than $20. The $20 could be anywhere on their person. You might search their wallet and their pockets, but the $20 could be stuffed in their sock. Even if you didn't find it your claim is still false. How does one interpret ""having"" $20. Maybe they don't a $20 bill but they have at least $20 in their bank account and access to that account in most situations. To prove the nonexistence of something you would have to prove that the claim is either impossible or that so much evidence is lacking that it can't be true. For me, personally, the absence of evidence is enough proof that gods don't exist. But the idea of faith is the ultimate ""I had one hiding my sock"" argument.",1061

I sometimes get all organized and list out what's happening and what I need to do --in advance-- and sometimes it's chaotic and I'm back filling tasks like ""just did"" instead of to-do. I really enjoy making spreads, I find it relaxing. It also eases my (realistic) fear that I'll forget all about something I'm supposed to do if it isn't written down. I think it would help to figure out what works for you. That's the beauty of the system, there's no one right way. Edited to add-- I switch up the look of my spreads and layouts fairly often. Folks sometimes talk about how it should be useful, or it doesn't need to be pretty or not comparing to IG or whatever -- which I understand. However, the way my attention works is that if it's not cute and interesting I will forget all about it and then half my trackers don't get filled out. So I make super pretty cover page and monthly calendar, a tracker page and braindump /notes page -/but the real work happens in the weekly spread. I can't draw so I use stencils and stickers. I do work to make my weekly as useful as possible -- for me that pretty much means keeping it simple. (But still cute) my most common set up is 3 vertical boxes on each page, with the last one split for the weekend. (Week starts on Monday). It's deceptively simple bc I use distress inks, stencils, markers. It tends to look like a lot is going on but structurally is like : write daily tasks and appointments in column, general notes and reminders below. I either leave space blank beneath or do a smaller box below the column. Visually complex but structurally simple works great for me. My memory is super shredded so I do a quick monthly recap page and put favorite memories. I go back to those a lot! Helps me keep good memories!!

His career has followed a very similar trajectory to Robert Pattinson in so much as, following Twilight, RPatz experienced a huge rise to fame and, exactly the same thing happened, woman and teen girls loved him and people were quick to label him as the talentless pretty boy. Obviously, since then both actors have been very clever with their project choices and have picked varied and interesting roles which have allowed them to prove that they are some of the best working actors out there, regardless of their looks.

I can offer no references into this reasoning. Instead, you might want to look into different societies and how they organize themselves in relation to gender and gender roles expectations. A specific study which comes to mind is the differences between Mundugumor, Arapesh and Tchambuli societies by Margaret Mead ([link](https://faculty.washington.edu/stevehar/Temperament.pdf)). Other redditors might be able to offer better references which include socioeconomical aspects and gender relations, but I would take those with a grain of salt, as they will most probably be correlational relations, not causation.",932

t3_nmtltb,"1,000 page monster or 2 500's?",gzqt4q3,"If you have the standard word per page count for a word processor, (about 500 words per page) a 1000 page book is about 500k words, which is really long for a first book. Publishers balance the cost of printing with the expectations of the audience to find a preferred word count for different markets/genres and books that fit within that word count are generally more likely to be published; particularly first books. When you are established you can get away with more. General and literary fiction is best aimed at 90k words, fantasy at about 150k etc etc. There are many websites and blog entries dedicated to the optimal word count for different markets. Therefore finding a way to get your manuscript to manageable pieces makes it more likely to obtain an agent or commercial publication. This can be done by editing down or by cutting up into pieces. The problem with that solution is that books written in parts have a different story structure to single novels. Each part of novel of the series needs to be a complete story in itself with a longer story arc that connects the books. In addition, if you are trying for commercial publication they will not, for a first time author, accept a book from a series unless the first book stands alone if they don't publish the rest just in case your first book is a failure. So you need a first book that stands alone and a series that can continue it. If you just broke your book into 2 parts you will have a first volume without any kinda ending and that will be pretty much unpublishable. This is why for commercial fiction it's best to have a reasonable page or word count in mind before you start writing and why if you have a big story that's too big for 150k words you need to have an idea for a structure to the plot that breaks it into parts before you write the first part.",1836

Concrete is really good at keeping its shape and not breaking under compression, like if you were to push on either end of a block. If you were to pull on either end (tension), it wouldn’t be nearly as strong. The opposite is true for rebar. When you put them together, the weakness of the concrete in tension is balanced by the tensile strength of the rebar, and vice versa. The strengths of one offset the weaknesses of the other. You can go a step further by putting the rebar under tension before the concrete is set, so that when you release it, the slab is in compression. This makes it very strong, and is how most modern concrete structures are made.",779

Talking about cheating and cheating aren't necessarily the same thing. Sometimes people can have moments of weakness but change their minds before they follow through. Once you know though that's it. It may ruin your friendship with your friend. But let me tell you this if they are unable to be faithful to their partner then I don't know if that's a person you want watching your back.

t3_nohswt,How do I start my meditation journey?,h00so6g,"Mindfulness is a good way to “practice” - for example with a walking meditation. Don’t bring your phone! Or use headphones. Instead, notice what you are experiencing in the moment. Maybe the warmth of the sun on your face, and you notice the sensation of that, then you notice sounds- maybe birds. Just notice anything that comes into your awareness. Welcome it in, there it is, and then release that thought. The next will come. Alternatively you can walk and put all your awareness on the sensation and act of walking. Notice how your feet hit the ground, how your legs feel, toe, heel, forward, weight on the ball of your foot, are you leaning, just step , step , step , step. It’s 100% normal to just start with however much you notice - whether that’s 15 seconds or minutes. You can’t get it wrong.",803

It wasn’t Disneyland, and it also didn’t seem like it was a county fair or anything; but it had to be close enough to home that we could stop on the way. I couldn’t think of any place that seemed quite right and although I felt pretty sure that it happened, I also suspected that maybe I had dreamed it up, or remembered something else Alice-themed and turned it into that. Anyway, I kinda kept my eyes open to see if anything fit, but I more or less accepted that I wasn’t going to get an answer. Until one day I watched a video of someone exploring an old abandoned theme park, and when they got to the Alice in Wonderland attraction, there it was!

And the whole time I'm sitting there with my eyes closed, just tryna breathe through the turbulence and all I can think is ""I can hear a fucking cat."" Every so often, for hours theres meowing, and I'm thinking it must be this baby or just my sleep deprived, stressed imagination. And after like 8.5 hours on the plane, I'm literally running off because my next flight is due to leave as we land but is one of the few not yet cancelled, and I wanna try and make it. I see a woman, who had been maybe 2 rows in front the whole time, has a cat with her and I'm not insane it turns out.

t3_n2967c,How to learn philosophy without a degree?,gwi6ndz,"My personal advice is to start with a critical reasoning or beginning-level logic text. This foundation will allow you to better understand the structure of arguments, understand what makes an argument valid and/or sound, learn some of the rules of inference or common fallacies. The more you practice these skills the better you will become in constructing and deconstructing arguments, seeing flaws in arguments, and offering coherent rebuttals. This will help you when you then turn to other disciplines of philosophy, because now you can read the text like a philosopher would, understanding the premises and conclusions of the argument that the philosopher is making and being able to find the weak points in the argument and either tear their argument down, or patch it up so that it can survive similar critiques. Also, critical reasoning not only helps in better understanding philosophy, but it can also help you better understand almost any other academic discipline and learn to think better in general.",1014

Don't let that blind you to other opportunities (that may be more realistic) for your happiness in the future. If you don't mind me being brutally honest, (I am trying to be helpful here, it is kindly meant) I suspect you of allowing yourself to be carried away by your feelings before you have engaged the feelings of the other person.

Do everything you can in your power to exercise for at least 45-60 mins each day - anything that gets the heart pumping - whether it be a light jog, a walk up a hill or stairs, an online workout class. There will be times you just don’t feel like it but *these are the times you need to push yourself and do it*! During this time do everything you can to minimize over-eating and try to consume whole, nutritious foods. Allow yourself a break day once or twice during those two weeks if you need. After two weeks of dedication you should begin to notice small changes in your body and your mood. It’s once you notice those small positive changes that you’ll be able to see the benefits of exercise for yourself, and it becomes so much easier to make it habitual.",1084

t3_n3n499,ELI5: Why is it significant that Ingenuity was the first helicopter flight on another planet?,gwqsfyz,"117 years ago the Wright Brothers were the first to take flight on Earth. One week ago Ingenuity, a NASA drone helicopter, became the first to take flight on another planet. This flight represents a new beginning for deep space exploration. According to [NASA](https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/#Quick-Facts), the purpose of testing Ingenuity on Mars is to explore the feasibility of helicopter exploration on other planets. The most challenging part of exploring other planets is the extreme terrain, such as mountains, valleys, and caves. Our current rovers lack the capability to venture into these terrains, and because of that we lack knowledge about such formations. Imagine the view from a plane 30,000 feet in the air, compare that to what you see walking down the street. From the plane, you can see hundreds of miles across Earth and all of its contours. This sight advantage would aid in planet exploration, especially in astronaut navigation because helicopters can [""scout interesting areas ahead and relay images of the landscape""](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00909-z). The successful test flight on Mars proved to be an immense engineering advancement as the mission was full of [unknowns](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-succeeds-in-historic-first-flight). According to [this NASA fact sheet](https://mars.nasa.gov/files/mars2020/MarsHelicopterIngenuity_FactSheet.pdf), Mars’s atmosphere contains only 1% as much pressure as Earth’s, and the gravitational pull is only one-third the strength of Earth’s. Due to the lower air pressure on Mars, it is harder for a helicopter to create lift with its rotor blades. To combat this, engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) designed [two 4-foot-wide (1.2-meter-wide) rotor blades](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-succeeds-in-historic-first-flight) that can create the lift needed to fly this device. Another thing engineers had to overcome was the time for radio signals to travel to Mars and back. The radio delay made directly piloting ingenuity impossible. Instead, Ingenuity was flown [autonomously](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00909-z), similar to a drone. Leaving no room for errors in its software as this world surely lead to an expensive failure. This is just the beginning of aviation on other planets, NASA plans on testing its [85 million dollar](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanocallaghan/2021/04/12/nasas-85m-mars-helicopter-is-about-to-attempt-flight-on-another-planet-for-the-first-time-ever/?sh=3e1edec51226) helicopter in baby steps. Ingenuity’s [first flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMnOo2zcjXA) only saw the helicopter rise 10 feet above the Martian surface and hover for about 30 seconds. The [second flight](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8930/nasas-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flies-faster-farther-on-third-flight/) saw it rise 16 feet and then traverse 164 feet at a top speed of 6.6 feet per second, traveling far enough to exit Perserverence’s [camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNx9hcrUpww&amp;t=5s) view. While these may not be thrilling maneuvers, it is still just the start. Two more flights are planned to further test the capabilities of Ingenuity. This mission proved it is possible for a controlled helicopter to fly on another planet. This accomplishment will pave the way for future helicopter missions on other planets. TLDR: Ingenuity proved it is possible to fly on other planets with current technology",3539

This state is inherently unstable and jostling the water could lead to it erupting and to severe burns. *However*, this only occurs if the water is placed in a vessel that's too smooth or hydrophobic for the nucleation process of boiling to take place.

t3_n66fhl,What’s it like being in a poly relationship? How do the dynamics differ from a monogamous relationship?,gx5bf7l,"It depends a lot on the structure of the relationship. There's no single style of poly - you could have a closed group, or a small web, or a chain that stretches a dozen+ people. I've not been in a ""closed group"" (small group - 3-4 - that is all in a relationship with each other) or a ""v"" (one person who's dating two other people but those people are monogamous with the shared partner); I've been in a polycule while dating two other people, both of whom had other relationships (some of whom had other relationships as well). In that situation, it's all about time management. Sometimes someone will have plans and then something comes up and it throws the plans out of whack. But usually it's all just scheduling and such; with one partner I generally went out with her on Wednesdays, and she had other plans on certain days as well. Really, though, there wasn't much difference than just having a monogamous romantic relationship, but also having different friends you hang out with on different days. In fact, when I was in that situation, it somewhat amounted to that, as I had met those two individuals through different friend groups and we went to those mutual interest events together. That's not to say another relationship can't have other dynamics or elements thereof; there's no one way to do poly right (though there are ways to do it wrong). But it's also difficult to really generalize beyond that for that reason. I also know closed triads who more or less do things as a group together.",1507

Is this weird or rational thinking?,gx5eplh,"I don’t think “weird” or “rational” matter very much here. The question is whether this thinking is *helpful* or *productive.* Okay, so it bothers you. Does that mean you want to only date men who are physically larger than you? Does that mean you want to get over it? You feel this way because our society crams our brains full of all sorts of ridiculous ideas about women’s bodies. You’ve been socialized to equate your value as a human being with your physical aesthetics, and to associate “beauty” and “femininity” with physical daintiness and smallness, especially vis-a-vis male bodies. These are constructs; they have little to do with what actual people actually value in one another, and with what actual people actually find attractive in one another. But socialization is very powerful, and knowing these are just societal norms you’ve been brainwashed into doesn’t mean it’s easy to let them go. So, you decide what you want to do. If it bothers you so much you can’t enjoy this relationship, you can end it and look for someone larger, you can devote your precious time and energy to trying to make your own body smaller, or you can do some work on yourself to un-learn these harmful ways of thinking about female bodies.",1234

This is how we show empathy (feel what we think other people will feel), explore hypotheticals, evaluate options based on how other people might react, etc. But once you have a ""theory of mind"" you can turn it on any mind...including your own. So we can ""think about our own thinking"". Like a lot of other higher functions, it's an emergent property of complex neutral structures in our brains. Exactly when it shows up is very hard to know for sure because it's clearly not there when you don't have any brain at all, and it's clearly there at some point after we do, so we can pin down a window, but it appears to show up before we've developed the ability to speak or otherwise communicate complex thoughts so we can't tell other people about it when it first shows up.",1018

You don’t notice that you’re being hit billions (trillions? more?) times a second because that’s just called air pressure, and it’s been happening since the day you were born. It’d be a problem if they were all moving in one direction though. Anyway, wind is just a slight bias to all those particles moving. When they touch you, they carry off some sweat, which your body dumps heat into before squirting it out to evaporate, carrying that heat with it. With a breeze, more air particles are hitting you, and they’re “new” in that they haven’t already picked up sweat, leaving more room for sweat to evaporate into it, and more air overall.",804

You're technically not using your body or mind (other than the automatic processes that go on without your control [heart beating, cells dividing, etc]). But I'd guess that's not exactly the intent of your question. Unless there's a way that we haven't thought of yet, our bodies and minds are our only way of interacting with anything in the physical world. Free will is a glorified (and necessary) illusion. Everything you are and all of the actions you take are predetermined by previous stimuli. Who you've interacted with, what you've consumed (physically and mentally), etc. You (and everyone else) reacts to a situation based on past knowledge. But, without that illusion, we'd feel trapped. It may be an illusion, but it's a necessary one. You could dip into the realm of pseudoscience, but a lot of those sorts of topics don't have much scientific backing (hence being classified as pseudoscience). And, final point, using free will to choose to not use your body or mind would be ""using your mind"".

It's worth emphasizing that when there's talk of how difficult the job market is, that is also including people with less than average publishing habits / fellowship success, etc. Of course, it's still difficult, and there's so much that is out of your control. It sounds to me like you think you would prefer to be a professor if you could get that to align with what is obviously the most important thing: your family. I'd suggest, first, talking to people to try to get a sense of how you are doing and how you are perceived relative to grad students at top universities. Second, have a good look at what you would actually need to do differently in order to apply for jobs/postdocs next fall. For some people this is a huge burden, while for others it takes no time at all. What type are you? If you've published a bunch and managed to win a prestigious fellowship, that makes me think you are good at selling yourself and your research, which is half the battle. There's nothing lost, except your time, in sending out some applications, as long as you can manage it psychologically. And if you do get an offer, you can consider then whether it is worth taking, overall. One thing I would not suggest, though, is limiting your applications too severely. Having two offers could give you a lot more leverage in getting jobs for you and your spouse in the same university. One thing I didn't understand in your post is "" I know deep down that a TT job is a long-shot, even if I uproot my family and move to some far-flung city or quit my job to take on multiple adjunct or post doc positions.

To get to 100 GB with 50 000 images they only need to be 2MB each. Digital cameras and telescopic mounts can be remote-controlled. So you can set it up so it captures lots of images of the moon while the telescope tracks it. You will take a lot of images of the same part and stack them to reduce noise and show parts that emit very little light. They can also remove images that are bad for some reason like an aircraft passing through the field of view. There are special programs for this. Stacking is very common was tor capturing faint objects in the sky. You can then stitch together the images that are outputted by the stacking program is dedicated panorama programs or even in photoshop.

So, as a kid I kinda always liked that guy because he always used to take me out for some ice creams or some snacks sometimes he also used to bring cool gadgets from his store so that I can play with it. One day he was talking to my dad about finance and stuf and while talking my dad told him about some money my dad was going to get. After some days passed he asked my dad if he can borrow some money from us which was kind of odd for us because he was doing very well financially so why does he needed the money for. But anway my dad said no because you when there is a feeling that something is not right with this person and you can't define it in words. After some months passed and one day those 2 girls told my parents that they were not comfortable when that guy was around and he was giving kinda creepy vibes. So, my parents didn't thought much and told that guy to leave the house after the month is over and he did left the house got a apartment just couple of blocks away and even after leaving the house he invited us to his wedding too. After a year or so in the morning I was getting ready for my school and one of the family member from 2nd floor comes down with a news paper and showes it to my dad turns out ""that guy manipulated his widow neighbour to help him rob her in-laws and they took all thier savings and jewellery and ran out of the city.""

Plotinus never talks about having a ""modest"" or ""immodest"" intellect, though, and I don't really know where this is coming from. An intellect is something that we have in virtue of having the kind of soul that we do. There is nothing in principle stopping anyone from being/becoming happy. But of course, many people waste their lives, pay attention to things that waste their time, etc. That's why Plotinus spends so much time in VI.1 talking about why it is wrong for souls to pay attention to things that are ""beneath"" them. You'll never find a satisfactory account of happiness and how we attain it in Plotinus, though. You need to read Porphyry's *Launching-Points to the Intelligible* for that, where he lays out the process step-by-step.",1091

I was bawling my eyes out, and very embarrassed. She said that her and her kids were having dessert and they had brough too much, so if it was okay with my mom I could come over and have some dessert too. My mom said fine, and I walked over, still crying but glad to be out of the situation for a minute. She gave me some dessert and water and I sat with her and her family, she let me call my dad too. When she went to take me back, she told me that things wouldn’t be like this for ever, that one day I would be grown up and I wouldn’t have to deal with this anymore, that none of this was my fault. It meant so much to me, to know I wasnt crazy and this wasn’t normal, that other people could see how wrong this was too. My dad picked me up the next day. I didn’t see my mom for years.

Each greek word links directly to the online dictionary, some words are available from multiple dictionaries, and extensive example from the Greek corpus can also be seen. &gt;... I wonder if the Greek word that Aristotle used has all of the same connotations that come with that word in English. It is hard to say, in some instances the translator may swap out Aristotle's choice of word to better convey the modern connotations, this is why translations can differ substantially. Moreover, some words using in the work of ancient Greek philosophers have not satisfactory english translations, examples include *logos*, *tolma*, *ananke* and so forth - whole books have been written on each of those. &gt;... it seems like the line numbers have no obvious relationship. This is because the arrangement of phrases in the ancient Greek language are different to that in English, so the word do not match one to one from the English to the Greek line. For instance there is no indefinite articles ""a"" in ancient Greek, so they are added by the translator depending on context, or on occasion omitted where they could be added.",1418

t3_ncjmse,"In the book ""Psychobiology of Gene Expression,"" author Ernest Rossi proclaims that mapping the human genome provides us with enough evidence to put to rest discussions of mind/body dualism and the nature/nurture debate. Is this true?",gy6urha,"No, it's not true. Insofar as there is an explanatory gap for consciousness, mapping the human genome did nothing to bridge it. Frankly, even as someone who is skeptical that the explanatory gap is anything but transient, I wouldn't even bring up the human genome in arguing against some kind of mind/body dualism. Nor did it do anything to settle debates about ""nature vs. nurture."" For one thing, it's not really clear that such debates---common as they are among the folk---are even *cogent*: even if we could draw bright lines for what we meant by the relevant terms (difficult!), we can't say of a person, this is the part of them that is nature and this is the part that is nurture, because the relevant causal processes just don't work like that. What scientists actually do is say are things like ""this amount of variation within the sampled population is due to genetics""---but that's a *very* different thing than settling the popular debates over nature and nurture. (Why? Take a classic example, namely studies of academic performance among adopted children. The set up for the experiment is that you find a bunch of adopted children, test them, their adoptive mothers, and their biological mothers in a certain way. What you tend to find is that the variation among the children is largely explained by the variation among the biological mothers: children who score high relative to the other children in the sample tend to have biological mothers that score high relative to the other biological mothers in the sample. Nothing like the same thing happens with adoptive mothers. *But that doesn't settle the issues that we care about*. Suppose the average adoptive mother score is a B, and the average biological mother score a C (adopters who aren't related tend to be well off, women who put their children up for adoption tend not to be able to afford to raise them, and socio-economic status correlates with academic achievement). What you tend to find in these studies is that the children will average a B. So even though the variation among the children is best explained by variation among the biological mothers, their overall academic performance as a cohort is best explained by the academic performance of their adoptive mothers.)",2255

We all worked in the same room (boss man included), but she delegated all the work and was who we would go to with any questions/issues we might have. A few days into my employment the assistant informed me I was in violation of the dress code. I was wearing one of those flowered one piece rompers that were so popular in the early 90’s. Although the hem hit right above my knee, no cleavage showed, it wasn’t tight fitting, etc., it did have spaghetti straps. I was given two options - stay in the outfit and receive a write up or go home and change on my lunch hour. As I was young and did not question authority at the time, I simply complied. I got back to the office, out of breath and famished, with one minute of my lunch hour to spare. Boss man happened to be sitting at his desk when I walked in to the data entry room. He looked at me quizzically and asked if I had been wearing something different when he saw me earlier. I explained the dress code thing and stressed I really didn’t want a disciplinary action in my file, especially so soon after starting.

So my parents (mom and dad) my brother (15M) and I (18F) were hiking in Arizona on a fairly well known and established trial. My mom was getting kind of tired but wanted to get a picture from a peak, and so her and I decided to split off my dad and brother at a well made fork in the road, and go up the side that said it was twenty minutes to the top instead of another two hours to the top, and then head back. We hike up this smooth incline, get there easily (there is only one way from this trail head) come up to this small circle of cleared land with no other way down, and start on our journey back home that should’ve only taken another hour. When we get back home my dad and my brother are incredibly worried, saying we’ve been gone for hours and they beat us home, and upon checking our phones we’d been gone for almost six hours (no way was that possible) walking the exact same trail we’d taken back. I thought they might be prancing us but if they had there was only one way back and we should’ve bumped into them, or at least seen them at a distance. My mom and I tell my brother and dad what we saw and how they’re yanking the wool over our eyes, and we all just agree it was something weird. The next day my mom takes me and my brother to walk the trial we have the day before because of how pretty it was, and we get to the exact same fork in the road (as noted by the signs) and trek off into what was familiar terrain for me and my mom, but soon, walking on a single path with no way off of it, the trail starts getting steeper and steeper and steeper and less and less familiar until we come out to a large expanse of space with a second path that goes down it and regroup on the trail head. This makes no sense to my mom and I at all. We head down the other side, and when checking out pictures can verify the path started out identical to the one we were on the day before, but the first day we came out to a trail point that one of the park workers (who walked the routes every day all day essentially) had never seen before.",2203

Examples: Installing a new smoke detector in your house is important, but not extremely urgent (whether it is done in the next 5 minutes or the next 5 hours doesn’t make much difference) If your house is on fire, putting it out, or calling the fire brigade, is both important and urgent. If your house is on fire and the big football game is about to start on tv, sitting down to watch the start of the game may be urgent but it is not important. Deciding what colour the casing should be on your new smoke alarm is neither urgent nor important. “Urgent” implies someone is urging you to do something quickly.

t3_ndsd7z,ELI5: Why do same notes from different musical instruments sound different?,gydbpl7,"Its like making lemonade. Everyone has a different lemonade recipe that makes different tasting lemon-drinks, but most of us can still recognize that its lemonade. Every musical instrument has a different mixture of sounds that it makes when we play it, but in the end most of us hear the same note. Here's a little music theory: When we play a note on an instrument, we are trying to create a sound with a specific pitch. This target is called the fundamental tone (or first harmonic). But when we pluck a string or blow air through a chamber, we actually create a mixture of tones (called overtones or higher harmonics) that accompany the fundamental tone. Each instrument has a different mixture that it makes, causing the overall note we hear to sound different. We call this quality the sound's timbre. [Here's a video graphing the tones of different instruments playing the same C3 note.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRAXK4QKJ1Q) See how even though the note played is the same, the overtones (number, size, shape of the peaks on the right) are different. [Andrew Huang does some neat demos in his video about harmonics.](https://youtu.be/Wx_kugSemfY) * [At 3:27](https://youtu.be/Wx_kugSemfY?t=208), he compares the tones from a clarinet against a guitar. * [At 5:35](https://youtu.be/Wx_kugSemfY?t=336), he plays with overtones to create different synth sounds.",1373

I'd especially recommend [Rogue One vs. The Force Awakens — The Fault in Our Star Wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsIQa7sH5_Y); despite being movies with no narrators, one of them still has a lot of ""telling"" about the main characters vs the other one ""showing"" us the main character. This comparison of two movies within the same franchise and time period is a good cinematic introduction to the concept of what ""showing"" and ""telling"" are. If you've got an Amazon account, I'd also recommend Sandra Gerth's ""Show, Don't Tell"", which is a free eBook on the Kindle app. Because it's free, it a little broad and barebones, but that also makes it a really good introduction to the concept and how one can work on their biggest ""telling"" weaknesses. Caveat: younger or newer writers tend to take guidelines, analysis, and suggestions as writing *rules* - ""X is bad and overdone, so don't ever do it and if you use it, your writing is bad"". As you do more research, it's easy to fall into the trap of ""I must never do this thing/use this word/write this structure"", but whatever it is, I guarantee you'll find popular contemporary authors and classics which do use it. These are exactly what I called them: guidelines (to give you a sense of direction whenever you feel lost about your writing), analysis (to help you figure out your strengths and weaknesses, lean into the former, and overcome the latter), and suggestions (ideas for what you can try if you can't think of anything on your own).",1625

Their business isn't providing a platform for you to speak and keep in touch, they are in the business of selling advertising opportunities to other businesses. Google does the same thing. Don't give apps on your phone permissions they don't seem to need, but require anyways. Yeah, you may not be able to use the app, but think about what the app can do with that permission. If you tell an app it can access your microphone, you have given it permission to access the microphone. At all times (some phones allow you to limit it to when the app is in use only, but who knows what the phone classifies as in-use). And keep in mind a lot of in-app setting don't have to be performing what they say they are.

He needs to know how you feel so you can work together to try to solve the problem, don't just give up. Obviously don't tell him about the other guy, just tell him you feel that some of the passion is missing and you need to figure out with him how to get it back. If you can rekindle the flame with your BF then the urges for other guys will disappear. This would be the healthy way to deal with the situation. If you decide to jump ship as soon as you find someone else more attractive then that cycle will never stop. Maybe you start a new relationship with the guy from work then 3 years down the line you find someone else more attractive and you want to leave again? Its always best to try to work things out with the guy you already know and trust.",813
t3_nf6eyz,How can I better connect with my half-sister and brother?,gyjydgb,"hi, i think its amazing and really sweet that you want to become a part of their lives and i wish you all the best for the future! you should definitely talk to their mom first about it because you already mentioned that she's a bit nervous and i think having an honest heart to heart talk would be beneficial to both of you- it will not only give you more insight into their lives and ways in how you can help with the kids; but it will also remove any feeling of apprehension or fear that the mom might have regarding your presence in the children's lives. A parent's approval is really important that way. After that, you could try doing activities like going to the park w the younger sister or spending time w the brother and indulging in his hobbies You could also try taking them out for food or just ice cream in general lol. If you're free ,you could come over to their place like once or twice a week to spend time w them. If the younger one is interested, you could try reading to her and maybe bond over it??She might end up gaining a new hobby and you will be able to create a safe haven for her.

I’m finding that for most people, they have only ever had them steamed with salt and pepper but that’s not the way. Most people also overcook them. If your Brussels sprouts start smelling like sulphur, they’re over cooked and they’re gonna taste bitter and gross. First time I had them, they were tossed in olive oil and oven roasted with bacon, then finished with a drizzle of balsamic and it was amazing. Then I learned different ways to prepare them, how to bring out the best flavor. Now one of my favorite recipes is a pasta dish with Brussels sprouts, onion, apples, sage, nutmeg, and pancetta. Most people won’t even try it because they hate Brussels sprouts. They don’t know what they’re missing.",755
t3_nf7oro,What is the feasibility of Governmental cover ups as claimed in some conspiracy theories?,gyk0onm,"I guess some of them are *in theory* pretty feasible... the thing is most of them wouldn’t have remained secret for long. Humans are pretty awful at keeping secrets for long (Thank the Universe for that). The more people you have to implicate, the shorter the time it’ll take for someone, somewhere, to let slip something concrete, and a lot of these conspiracy theories would require dozens, if not hundreds or even thousands, of collaborators. Just look at real conspiracies to get that. Here’s a pair of examples from two wildly different times: The Gunpowder Plot didn’t manage to stay secret long enough to be completed, Watergate was revealed almost instantly. Now imagine how many people would have been required to say... cover up a faked 9/11 and tell me if you think all those people could have kept their mouths shut for 20 years.",841

Or why people treat people this way. I never have gotten an explanation they are just there one day and gone the next. It sucks and I feel for you. The only advice I can give you is point blank ask them one day what is going on and hope that they care enough to be honest with you.

t3_ngobfk,ELI5: How do sailboats sail if the wind isn’t directly behind them? How about if the wind is coming from the front or perpendicular? Do they just sit there and wait?,gys02rb,"Sailboats have a [skinny and very deep keel](https://www.bestboatreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.jpg). It's like a board that goes down from the centre. The result is the boat can easily move forward/back in the direction it's pointing, but very hard to move sideways in the water. You can also pivot the sail. You can turn it to catch the wind, which puts a diagomal push on the boat. But it can \~only move forwards, so it just goes forwards. Can you ice skate? This is a super close process. You don't push straight back to to forwards. You push back and to the side, so there's a diagonal force on your gliding leg. The skate can slide easily in the forwards/back direction, but greatly resists slipping sideways. So upon getting that diagonal push it just slides forward, the easier direction of travel. Yes, the more the wind is from behind, the more efficiently you can use it to sail (the greater % of the wind's speed your boat will go). But you can make use of any wind direction to sail any direction with at least *some* speed. The hardest case is if you want to go directly against the wind. The process to do this is called tacking. Basically you can't sail straight into the wind, but you can go diagonally against it up to a certain angle.

I'd hardly said a word for the 2 weeks and just pretty much sat there staring into space. When out of nowhere my nan says something along the lines of ""you should be grateful that your mum looks after you like she does, your dad never did anything for you, whats he ever done? he wasn't bothered about you."" And whilst yes, 14 years later I realise that he wasn't really that bothered about me; but did she really need to say it 2 weeks after he died? Needless to say things went worse after that.

t3_nhzfbn,What one thing disgusts or angers you to your core?,gyz3ub6,"This is a super petty one but: I watch a lot of sponge rinsing ASMR. It's basically just videos where people rinse a soapy sponge. But the problem is that in at least 80% of videos, they don't actually finish rinsing the sponge. Like at the end there's still soap in it. And I always thought it was a universal thing to find it unsatisfying to see something left unfinished and incomplete. Like sometimes I've seen random YouTube videos that are supposed to be unsatisfying and they're always something being done unevenly or done partially and left incomplete. Like imagine you see a video of someone cleaning a window and they clean 90% of it but leave a dirty spot. That's unsatisfying and frustrating, right? Doesn't everyone feel that way? But apparently I'm the only one in the sponge rinsing community who cares if the sponges are fully rinsed, because in most videos they're not and those videos get just as many likes as the ones that actually finish rinsing and never have any dislikes. And just, how‽ I honestly find it frustrating and stressful when the rinse is left incomplete. And it actually angers me that nobody else cares at all, that even though you'd think it's universal to find it unsatisfying to see something just partially done and left unfinished and incomplete, nobody else cares. I mean the whole point of these ASMR videos is to be satisfying, they often have ""satisfying"" in the title, but it's exact opposite of satisfying to leave something incomplete! How does no one else see that‽ So since no one besides me cares, the people who make the videos don't bother to make sure the sponges are fully rinsed. Sometimes they will be, but in most videos they're not. And I really, really love the sponge rinsing ASMR videos where the sponges actually are fully rinsed, but I have to search through so many unsatisfying, frustrating videos where the rinse is only partially done in order to find them. It seriously makes me mad that I'm the only one who cares whether the rinse is actually finished or if the person just does a half assed job and only partially rinses the sponge and leaves soap in it at the end.",2139

t3_nj6uci,High/Epic Fantasy with romantic subplot?,gz5xi5f,"You seem to have almost exactly the same taste as I do, so let me see if I have a few suggestions. Naomi Novik's Uprooted and Spinning Silver, while each a stand alone book, gave me very similar vibes to the Winternight trilogy. Both have romance, but it's next to a fascinating fantasy based plot, deep relationships between female characters, and excellent character development. What I really like about her books is that the heroines have goals and character development outside of the romance, and the romance doesnt solve all of their problems, while still being really compelling. Kristin Cashore's books are YA/NA with a slightly more romance focus, but similarly, her female characters all have goals and plot points that don't solely revolve around the love interest. The world building is really interesting. Graceling, Fire, Bitterblue, etc. Susan Dennard's Witchland series is super popular. While I didnt like the direction the plot took in later books, I know I'm in the minority, and it really fits the bill of what you described. Female POV (though there are multiple POV's including men), epic fantasy, multiple books to sink your teeth into. The romance is there, but it's a minor plot point for sure, at least in the first two books. S.A. Chakraborty's Daevabad Trilogy is fantastic. Honestly, if you pick any one of my suggestions, this is the one. It has everything, politics, magic, romance, excellent character development. I would say that the first 15% of the first book tricks you into thinking it's going to be a run of the mill fantasy romance in terms of plot, but really she's just setting up this complicated world with some plot beats that are more familiar to the reader. (At least that's my opinion of what's going on). The romance is there, but the plot is really more focused on character development and exploring issues of privilege and tribalism while luxuriating in this lush middle eastern setting. Lois McMaster Bujold's Sharing Knife series is slightly more romance focused than Witchlands or the Daevabad trilogy. But at 4 books, it's meaty, and there is a good fantasy adventure plot that takes equal space with the romance. I honestly recommend anything Lois McMaster Bujold writes.",2229

t3_njbitq,What are some Director Cuts that arguably make things worse for the movie?,gz7wqro,"The Warriors. One of the charms of the movie is its atmosphere and feel - it has a low budget but still well made, gritty, late 70s New York at night thing going on. The Director's Cut decides to shove in cheap looking, mid 2000's ""animated comic"" segments at the start of the film as wall as randomly interspersed throughout. The opening just complete spells out one of the primary things the story is based on, which I feel ruins the possibility of finding that out after the movie is over and making you look at it in a different light. And the comic overlays in other moments just rob the film of that aforementioned atmosphere - even if it's just for a few seconds, the magic is gone. The saddest part is the Bluray is Director's Cut only, no theatrical cut. Whoever owns the Warriors, please put out another Bluray of the theatrical cut and I bet a lot of fans would buy it a second time.",894

t3_njbsh9,"Every few weeks, I feel extremely discouraged about my story, and make drastic changes to it. How do I stop doing that?",gz70wvw,"I think you are trusting your gut by making those changes. Every time we write, we learn how to write a little bit more. We notice our mistakes, discover plot holes, realize something we thought was cool last week is actually boring and falls flat. That isn't a bug, love, it's a feature. Personally, for myself, I don't commit to writing my first draft until I love every part of it so much that I couldn't dream of changing another thing. Even then, during that process, there are things I realize I loved for the wrong reasons, or things that just don't allow for the best flow, and I change them anyway. If you're getting bored with something you've created, the best case scenario is that you've just gotten too close to it and as a writer, you find it less exciting. The more likely scenario is that your skills have improved and you're able to realize it is actually boring and readers wouldn't enjoy it either. If I were you, I would focus less on wanting to have more confidence in my writing, and just trust the process instead. Trust that this is a very natural part of becoming a better and better writer. Every time you're dissatisfied with something, that is what should build your confidence, because you just got better than when you wrote it and now you can see its flaw. The more flaws you notice, the more you should be trusting in your ability to notice them. Seeing what we do wrong is one of the best parts of learning to improve.",1452

t3_nkfz1a,What was ruined because it got too popular?,gzcpzgb,"Nerd rant! I hope I don’t get attacked for this, but San Diego Comic Con comes to mind. I used to attend back around 2006ish and it was definitely busy but much more chill. You could log onto the site a few months beforehand and buy a ticket without too much trouble. I stopped going around 2010, by then it was pure mayhem and they soon started doing lotteries to buy tickets. The lines are face-melting too. Good luck getting any sort of decent hotel anywhere near the venue. I think Twilight was the cause; I saw a big shift in the crowd (size and makeup) around the time it exploded.

t3_nkfqg2,People who hoarded gas two weeks ago: how are things going for you now?,gzec7uu,"Every year, before hurricane season, I 'hoard' 40 gallons of gas in 8 approved 5-gallon containers for the season for generator usage in case of power loss. I add sta-bil to each can when I fill it at the station so it mixes well during the fill. 40 Gallons will run the generator to keep my house functional and not ruin my food, etc, for about 2 weeks or so if I run it ~8 hours a day. Then right before the next hurricane season (Which starts June 1st), I use all of them in my truck over 1-2 fill ups, It's quite easy, as my truck has a 37 gallon tank. Then I do the same thing again. Storing gas is just a scheduled thing in hurricane country. So if you've got gas to get rid of, Hurricane season starts next week. People in hurricane country already typically have the means to store it, maybe we'll buy it from you.... at a discount :P",842

Over the course of our 2 weeks together I grew close to her, still not speaking much, but getting comfortable with her physical affection and comforting her during her breakdowns. I liked her, but like with every girl I meet, I immediately think of all the reasons why she would never date me or why I couldn't burden her with dating me. What really drove that mentality with her was overhearing a phone call she had with someone that sounded a lot like a conversation one would have with a boyfriend and just like that I concluded that it would be impossible. After the 2 weeks she was about to get released (I came in a week after her so I still had a week to go) 10 minutes before she was about to leave and join her parents we sat at a table and said our goodbyes when she hit me with ""So are we dating now ?""

Anyway, I can't speak for every schizophrenic person, but I don't find myself offended by this type of portrayal.

About the meds; this can be a contentious issue. I for one see medication as a positive thing, because it allows me to remain functional. Do I wish they didn't have side effects? Sure. There are others with schizophrenia who don't take medication and can function without it.

t3_nlu1a9,ELI5 what the calibers like .45 or .50 mean and why is the .308 such a specific number?,gzkumow,"I feel like your question has been answered but as for the ""such a specific number"" part, remember that guns are typically machined goods with milling and broaching and all that. It's common in a machine shop to use measurements in thousandths of an inch, so specifying .308 specifically wasn't really out of reach for machinists and their tools. It's actually pretty easy to find calibers measured in thou like .338 Lapua Magnum, .454 Casull, or .303 British) since the tools for that kind of precision have been around for a bit over a century now. Also note that there's at least a few calibers I can think of immediately that are hundredths of a millimeter, (7.62, 5.56, 7.65 Parabellum, 7.35 Carcano...) .01mm is about four tenths (.0004 inches) so technically it is even *more* specific.",793

t3_nmz9i7,ELI5: Why does the order of a resistor not matter in a series circuit?,gzrjf20,"Imagine you connect several pipes to supply water somewhere. The pipes have different diameters. The bigger diameter - the more water can fo through that single pipe in a period of time. I.e. speed of water (current) depends on pipe size. When connected in a series, the pipe with smallest diameter sets the limit for water flow speed (maximum current) for the whole pipe system. You can't make the water flow faster than it can flow through the smallest pipe The same principles are applicable for electric current. The wire is a pipe, the electric current (directed flow of charges, for example electrons) like a waterflow. The resistance is a value that depends on wire section area in inverse proportion. Also the voltage can be seen as a height difference between the pipe ends. If pipe is horisontal the difference is zero (no voltage), the water (and electrons) are not going anywhere. When pipe is not horisontal, the difference sets pushes water and electrons through the pipe (wire) and sets the speed (electric current strength, amperage). The sign of that difference (positive or negative polarity) sets the direction for current flow.

My manager didn't say anything to me, but I found notes about it in one of his notebooks. The office was shared, as was the only computer. I needed a password that I knew was written down in the notebook because he'd previously told me that's where I'd find it.

While I see it on the job most often, it can happen with anything that's stressful, from parenting, hanging out with certain people, large projects, and yes, job hunting. Burnout symptoms include but aren't limited to: * forgetfulness / hard time concentrating * loss of motivation / unable to cope * irritability * less healthy personal relationships with friends/family * pain, fatigue, insomnia Lots of things can be done to help alleviate all this. First, is time away from the stressor. I know you want/need a job, but you may need to take a break from job hunting to help you destress and refocus. Next, things like self care can help as well: eating well, exercising, trying to sleep on a good schedule. It's okay to feel good about yourself, even if it's hard to see things that way -- your worth as a person isn't determined by your employment status. Last (but this is not an exhaustive list), worry about the right things -- try to prioritize a bit more (not everything has to be done with the same urgency). Can you offload anything? Can you seek support from any friends/family/school connections? On a side note, if your chosen field is in software, I've been in the industry for a while, and may be able to help.

t3_no94wz,How to know when it’s time to stop working on a story?,gzytcet,"From what you've written in your post, it sounds like you've done what for you is the fun part, then given up as soon the work part started. If you want to keep dreaming up stories and never finishing them, you've got yourself the perfect formula. Writing a novel is **hard**. It takes weeks (more likely months) of sitting in front of a screen, on your own, putting out words. You need to motivate yourself. You need to fight the self doubt. You need to have discipline. Most of all, you need to get the romantic ideas out of your head that writing is some magical process, and accept that writing is work. It can (probably should) be enjoyable work, but it is still work. To answer your question, I know it's time to finish with a story when I've written it, rewritten it, rewritten the rewrite, and repeated until it's as good as I can possibly make it. After that I'm done. Apart from sending it to my beta readers, listening to their thoughts, and rewriting the parts that the majority didn't enjoy. Then it's done. Apart from then sending it back to the readers for their thoughts on my changes. And rewriting accordingly. And repeating that if necessary. Then it's done. Probably. Start to finish, for me, is around six months, working 9-6 four days a week, and at least three or four hours a day the other days.

His charisma and interpersonal skills are developed enough to lead and coordinate dozens of super-heroes. In older stories he created and maintained a small group of robots to guard the Fortress of Solitude and do minor tasks for him, which indicate an excellent understanding of robotics and AI.

t3_n3nkcg,What's your airline horror story?,gwqvm5k,"I had flown from California to Vancouver and had to catch a connecting flight to Penticton to see my family. My flight at LAX was delayed half an hour which some how translated into being delayed getting to Vancouver by another I guess 30 mins or so because of boarding and we sat on the runway for 800 years. I get there and the line up to get through customs is about 20 miles long, got through surprisingly quick considering but by that time I had to get ALL THE FUCKING WAY ACROSS THE AIRPORT in 15 mins and get through another security check on that side to make my flight, there was another line....thankfully the lady at that security was very nice and let me skip ahead but I asked no less than three other people to call the gate and let them know I was here and I was hauling ass and NO ONE would help me. There wasn’t even any of those luggage cart guys to beg for help. I made it to the gate just as the gate attendant was closing the door and she did let me run out to the small plane and board but she didn’t let me through without a snotty “This is why you’re supposed to be at the airport early.” I almost cut her throat on the spot.

t3_n3qw6c,"Employees of Domino's, what secrets did you discover while working there?",gwrigio,"If something is wrong, just call, it's company policy to just throw a free pizza at you to get off the call and back on the make line. I saw some really nasty things be justified by ""it'll go through the oven"", including picking toppings out of the trash (yes trash, by the end of the line, not the trays underneath) to save on the cost of whatever accidentally got thrown away. The loss comes out of their bonus so they are incentivized to cheat wherever they can. There was also this attitude of appearing perfect. Stores are scored on a system of points that an auditor goes through and scores. Some things they took off the computer screen, like service times (how long it takes to make each item and how long It takes for delivery drivers to clock back in) so managers will fly around the store skipping through all the steps to have the computer read it as finished before they even start. Seems harmless until you have an order say it's been delivered but they actually forgot to make it at all. Also, all the general managers busting ass for their usually measly bonus were all miserable. Even the guys at the high volume stores making 10k a month in bonuses were all grumpy and mean and sad. Toxic work culture for sure It seems like good money for small increases in work load when you're in highschool or college and hearing the bonus cap of 15k a month and suddenly you've been making 40k a year for a decade and no longer have the drive to finish school and spend your evenings complaining that you were only x amount of years or semesters from your degree but now can't leave the store unattended for even a whole day.

My boss asked me to take the intern out to show her how to use the train and subway system. So on her third day in Tokyo, we went out and caught a train for Yokohama. The train came to a screeching stop about 15 minutes into our ride. The conductor announced that there had been an accident, and asked everyone to remain seated and calm. Usually this means someone committed suicide by train, which is a very common problem in Japan. A few seconds later I turned to look out the window behind my seat, and sure enough there was a dark blue/purple teenage boy with deep cuts/bloodless lacerations all over his body. He was probably 14 or 15 from what I could reckon. Anyways, absolute terrible sight. However, I think the intern handled it better than I did.",879

Most bullies have terrible lives outside of school. Usually only one parent or abusive parents or something terrible and unfair, them being a bully probably isn't their fault. They are lashing out and craving the attention they don't get at home, they are probably terrible to teachers too. Give them some attention. Find common ground and try to bond over anything. It won't instantly work. You have to be persistent and will still get bullied. Little things like saying hi and asking how their weekend was when passing in the hall.

t3_n50lc8,ELI5: How is a co-dopant chosen while doping a nanoparticle? Can any pair of elements be used as co-dopants depending on the required properties?,gx2nx5o,"Three factors to keep in mind are crystal structure, number of electrons, and energy levels. You usually want a dopant that doesn't change the crystal structure too much - meaning it should either be a similar size to the atom it's replacing, or be much smaller so it can sit between atoms (this is called an interstitial). Usually the dopant will have a different number of valence electrons than the atom it's replacing, and the difference determines whether it adds or removes electrons (p-type vs n-type). The energy levels of the nanoparticle (HOMO and LUMO) and the energy levels of the dopant determine the doping efficiency - which is the fraction of dopants that actually dope the material. Energy levels also determine what the nanoparticles actually do, especially if you're absorbing or releasing light.",815

It’s one thing to be imperfect, but another to lie with irresponsible forms of intent.

t3_n55g0t,What service do you think is missing in today's society?,gwzeobu,"I think there ought to be an app that helps you pay your bills. It would have access to what your cash flow situation usually is. It would have access to being able to pay the bill, whichever bills you set up for it to pay. And I imagine it working something like this. You get paid on a Friday. And it's time to pay your utility bills. On screen it would show you that you owe $75 to electric, $50 to gas, $100 to cable, and what not. Then you would simply press the green button to pay each one of the bills that you want paid. And instead of having to log in to each and every business you owe money to, by simply pressing the pay button, that money is taken out of your account, the bill gets paid, and receipts are generated. I also see the app as being able to handle cash flow. So let's say I need $500 from each check in order to make rent. If I get one check that is $700, I don't have $700 to spend, I only have $200 to spend. And if app knows I owe $50 to an electric bill, I don't have $200 to spend I only have $150 to spend. So if I asked my app what my available balance is, it would not tell me that I have $700 it would tell me I have $150. I've never seen an app like this. And I think it would be pretty awesome.",1231

t3_n55rwn,"ELI5: How do antihistamines treat eye allergies, if the irritants are literally in the eye?",gwzgper,"When your eyes are itchy from pollen in spring time, it is caused by the cells of your immune system noting the pollen and recognizing it as harmful to you. A lot of different cells are involved with this immune response but ones with the ""big guns"" are called mast cells. They come on the scene and release histamine, which works to stop the pollen from doing any damage to you. Unfortunately histamine is really really itchy, so you can take an antihistamine to keep more mast cells from planting more histamine. You're right about the pollen leaving the eye through tears - that's what tears and blinking are supposed to do! The problem is that your body has already triggered the immune response, so even after the pollen is gone, it still takes some time for all the immune who were called in for battle to arrive, do their thing until no more threats are detected, then retire to the bloodstream.",902

This is the most popular view amongst philosophers, and comes close to Locke's memory criterion, but generally with more detail. * Biological continuity, which basically says we are animals and our persistence conditions are that of human animals (Eric Olson, Peter van Inwagen, Paul Snowdon, Stephan Blatti, David Wiggins etc.). This is the second most popular view, but one which has grown in popularity in recent years. * Souls or dualism or similar, which says there's something immaterial that we are, which accounts for our being (Richard Swinburne, Dean Zimmerman, Peter Unger sometimes etc.). A number of views sit in this one, but it's the grouping you'll find most theists in, and a lot of dualists (but generally not property dualists for example, who would be more likely to subscribe to the psychological view) * Anticriterialism, which means you are the same person between moments because you are the same person. No further analysis is possible or necessary, and identity (of any object) is simply one of the brute facts of the universe (Trenton Merricks, Marcello Oreste Fiocco, Ned Markosian sometimes etc.) This one sometimes goes hand-in-hand with dualism for example, but often is still entirely materialist. Personal identity is my particular area of specialism, and I don't know which account is right. I lean towards animalism over the psychological view, but I take anticriterialism and nihilism very seriously. Part of the issue is that wider philosophical themes are very important to this discussion - particularly mereology and time. There's no agreement on the nature of time, and until such a time (pun intended) as there is, we will struggle to make a ruling on personal identity.",2169
t3_n8u8q6,ELI5: What are eye floaters and why do we get them?,gxkhwpj,"Your eyes are full of a jelly substance known as the vitreous. Clumps of collagen can form, usually with age, that cause shadows to fall on the retina (the light sensitive part of your eye). If you get a lot of these suddenly, it could be an indication of retinal detachment or other issues, so get to an optometrist ASAP if this is the case. Normally though it's not a real concern, but they can be removed in certain situations by sucking the jelly out, filtering it and putting it back. Pretty major process so it's not done lightly.",536

Tackling the project every day for the first time probably 3 to 4 weeks. If you know the iron ores source that's a plus. The average rudimentary rifle will weigh around 15 lbs so you'll need to dig out 4 times that for ore. You'll need to create a crucible so add another two times that amount. You'll want to introduce carbon in the steel for strength so will need to find a way to create carbon in the steel so most likely burnt trees or bones from animals. Now you've got the crucible, the ore, and the carbon you'll need a form. Easiest is a sand relief form for the barrel and required other metal bits. Ideally you'd be a machinist and or an engineer. Coming up with a modern firearm in a primitive environment would be daunting. A small cannon or musket would be faster by about a week and have less steps.",874

t3_n8v0w0,What's the best way to learn a new language?,gxkkql0,The best way is interaction with people who speak the language. If you can make friends with people who speak the language and are willing to help you learn it is very effective. If you can date someone who speaks the language it is even better. Language courses (online or in class) are ok at teaching basics but to become fluent you need to immerse yourself in the language... you need to actually speak the language with people to learn effectively. If you're not ready to interact with people yet then online learning (duolingo or similar) combined with consumption of media is a good start. For example if you're trying to learn french try french subtitles with english audio or english subtitles with french audio on netflix/primevideo/etc. It can take a while (months) but eventually you start to understand the language fairly well. Practice makes perfect.,864

t3_na3fgm,What is the most effective way you've lost weight?,gxranks,"I stopped lying to myself, stopped ""giving up or cheating on my diet"", I got super serious. I calculated my RMR on google. Its a great estimate of daily caloric needs. I took my RMR, subtracted 500 cals. That was my new daily budget. If I accurately count calories, I'm guaranteed to lose 500 cals per day automatically, even if I just sleep all day. Then I was worried I'd fuck up on counting calories, so I padded every food, overestimated each item. I was probably closer to an 800 cal deficit each day. To make this diet work, Water was my only drink. No fucking sugar drinks. I also basically completely cut sugar and carbs from my diet. With a limited calorie budget, you need to load up on veggies and lean protein and healthy fats. The protein and fats will keep you feeling full and satiated longer, the veggies are lower calorie and plenty of fiber to give you that ""fullness"" feeling. I also chugged water with each meal to really help get that feeling of fullness that I was missing. But after a couple weeks I didn't need to. When you are fat, your stomach is stretched out and larger than normal. But over time eating smaller portions, your stomach naturally shrinks back down to a smaller size, so less food will be more filling. The diet work is by far the best move for weight loss. But I also hit the gym every single day. Cardio every day to burn an extra 100-200 calories, plus I'd lift 3 days per week so build muscle and get passive calorie burn from the muscle repair and growth. Also, working out daily will boost your metabolism, so you'll passively consume more energy (calories) all day each day. It worked better than my wildest dreams. The weight melted off me. In 10 months I lost like 130lbs.",1723

From what I've gathered, the point of the sub is to provide advice and techniques for basically leading people to conclusions that match your own experiences/worldview, instead of just telling them they're wrong, because people react negatively towards having their perceptions and biases challenged. Rather than challenge them directly, you basically just keep asking why it is they think/feel the way they do until you get to root causes of their thoughts/feelings, and make them examine it, help them to question whether or not what they are thinking/feeling is correct, or morally sound, or productive, etc, etc.",1123

If the other is held still, it will still experience a force from the spinning of the first one. If you replace the air with oil, the force transmitted is much higher. If you enclose the whole thing and shape the fans so that the air blowing past the 'output' fan gets recycled into the 'input' fan, you get a much more efficient system - the air doesn't have to come to a stop and so the energy of its motion can be reused. This is the physics behind the torque converter. This final step, of shaping the blades and casing to recycle the moving oil at maximal efficiency, is why the inside of a torque converter looks very little like the fans we started with.",797

t3_ncqlir,Is historical accuracy not necessary for my fantasy story?,gy6ojqa,"The whole ""historical accuracy"" thing is a difficult game. One route is to go Tolkien and build a full, self-consistent mythology, but that requires incredible patience and knowledge of history. The other is to go GRRM and model your world on some aspects of real history, do a ridiculously half-hearted job with other aspects of your world, and then sell your book as ""real"" history (to be clear, I like a lot of what Martin does, but [this blog](https://acoup.blog/2020/12/04/collections-that-dothraki-horde-part-i-barbarian-couture/) gives a great point-by-point analysis of how his portrayal of the Dothraki is lazily researched, historically nonsensical, and sells what are essentially ethnic stereotypes as ""real history""). My point is that you don't need full detail for everything--your world just needs to feel self-consistent. If I'm reading a story, I won't get (too) bothered if a character's job doesn't match the real historical job it was based on, or if the political organization of X culture isn't quite like Y culture it was rooted in, but I will be annoyed if the job is portrayed inconsistently within the story itself, or if X culture behaves in an illogical or implausible way. I will also note that you might run the risk of feeling derivative of real history if you base too much of your worldbuilding on the real one, especially if you're doing a version of a period that people might be familiar with, or has been portrayed similarly in fiction--maybe give Codex Alera a brief read and make sure you haven't duplicated anything by accident, or draw a little more from different cultures and periods. I get the sense that Rome and Medieval Europe are pretty common inspirations for a lot of fantasy stories, or even sci-fi, such as Panem in the Hunger Games; see what you can do to add a new spin, maybe by exploring the social myths surrounding why people love these periods, such as the idealized idea of chivalric culture for the medieval period, or notions of an orderly and invincible empire beset by barbarians that still surround Rome (the blog I mentioned actually does a [breakdown](https://acoup.blog/2020/01/17/collections-the-fremen-mirage-part-i-war-at-the-dawn-of-civilization/) of the trope of a decadent empire versus barbarians, which originated in cultural depictions of Rome, that's definitely worth a read)",2352

t3_ne05vg,To what extent does an undergraduate degree in philosophy cover the other social sciences?,gydo1cq,"For sure a double major or a minor is a great idea. Political science departments vary but often have at least one professor who is engaged fairly closely with philosophy -- and philosophy departments often have someone into political philosophy -- so it's a pairing that can be pretty natural. Setting aside more formal approaches like doing a double major, minor, or working with a particular philosopher, you'll usually have enough elective course options that you can pick up a couple courses in anthropology or whatever. You should have a look at what major/minor options are available at the universities you are considering, what the course requirements are for each, what courses in various departments you might be interested in, and -- if you're really a nerd -- what research the professors in the relevant departments are into. If there's an undergraduate philosophy society -- or polisci society, etc. -- at the universities you're considering, that you can find online, consider sending them an email and they might be able to give some specific advice for that university. Don't expect to just pick up political science, or whatever, by virtue of studying philosophy. Certainly there's oodles of work to do taking all the political philosophy courses you can take, and stuff like that; but if you want to know political science, study some political science -- and so on.",1386

t3_ne0hfm,ELI5: Why cant we retain all our memories and experiences as we get older?,gydr684,"It's not so much that we can't as it is that we don't have a need to. It has to do mainly with the way our brain stores memories in the first place. Over millions of years or biology developed a punishment/reward system to drive us to seek things that help us survive and avoid things that inhibit our survival. The positive or negative labeling of memories is a result of this system, and all memories are stored with some type of emotional association. When we are young many things we experience are new and exciting, and the emotional tags, either positive or negative, are also more intense and varied due to this novelty. As we grow older, however, individual events become less novel because they more often relate to previous experiences and are less likely to be stored in memory as they are less useful in terms of survival. This doesn't mean you are unable to remember things as you get older, as there are ways to train your brain to maintain neural plasticity as you age, but due to the fact that you're not experiencing as many new or intense things, especially not things necessary for survival, your brain has no need to expend the energy required to create long-term memories.

Loud noises and unwanted sounds stimulate these compensationaly-increased pathways, but since the brain is not rewarded with any recognizable pattern, the magnified stimulation is proportionately annoying. 4. This ultimately leads to a conditioned response of hypersensitivity to noise.",566

t3_nfe0cl,What's a psych trick you love to use?,gylqfcq,"I statements rather than ""you"" statements. People generally feel on the offensive when you put something on them, especially when there's an issue. For example, ""You did this wrong, can you try it again a different way?"" Putting the blame on them, makes them feel like you're accusing them. Consider ""I'm not sure if this is right, can we try this again a different way?"" Lacks the assumed accusation and shows that you're in it together, not just criticizing them and then leaving. I try to implement it even when it's not a problem statement. Instead of ""let me know if you need help with anything else"" I usually say ""let me know if there's anything else I can do to help."" Symbolically takes the burden off of",713

t3_ngsrx4,How can I enjoy writing again?,gyteigp,"It seems like you are writing for other people, not you, when you ""try to get everything right on the first try"". As others have pointed out, it's a mindset issue. So you need to practice writing stuff that is intentionally bad or never to be seen again. Pick up a copy of Natalie Goldberg's *Writing Down the Bones*. Read it. Begin a ""writing practice"" habit that is 15 minutes a day of freewriting in a journal, following her Rules for Writing Practice. This can be your way to just flow words onto a page, without worrying whether they are going into a story or not. One of the rules is ""don't think, don't get logical"". Practicing writing like this for 15 - 30 minutes a day, when you're taking breaks from other projects, may be a way to spark your joy of creation again. I love doing this.",795

I told my parents she was there but they did not see her. I turned to look again and she was disappeared. So we get into the house and, there she was cooking our lunch. I was shocked because the place where I had spotted her was REALLY distant and there’s no way she would have reached the house in five seconds. One more thing: she was dressed the same as I saw her in the fields, which made me sure what I witnessed was not a strange paranormal manifestation, or allucination.

That being said, if your own family hurts you, that's different. If you alienate your family for no reason, why shouldn't your kids ignore you in the future? Forget about not being able to meet their aunt/uncle; they don't have to give you respect either. I mean, I'm not trying to tell you, but just make sure that's what you really want.

t3_njceew,How do you ensure you're growing(intellectually) everyday?,gz6kjz5,"Well. I'm not 100% sure these methods are what you're looking for. But they should help. First of all is revision. Knowledge is pointless if you don't know how to apply it. There are many ways to revise such as using mind maps and flash cards. But my favourite is taking notes. And repeating them trying to memorize as much of it as you can. For example you could write ""This is a note"" Next you would write as much of it from memory as you can. Allowing yourself to check the original note. Keep doing it until you can do it without having to look back. Another way of doing so is having questions and actively finding the answers. Part of why we're so advanced is because smart people kept asking questions. Realised there was no good answer and so they decided to try and work it out themselves. The questions can be something stupid like how to mathematically prove 1+1=2 or really complex like just about anything to do with particle physics",946

t3_njet6g,Why are different cameras used for action scenes?,gz6yyx0,"Might not be different cameras. In my experience filming, I’d guess that it’s likely the frame rate. Different frame rates create different moods. For instance, when I film real estate houses for agents I export in ~25fps to give a wispy, cinematic feel. If I’m filming a movie with a high speed car chase, I might bump it up to 30fps to catch the flames and realism while still keeping that cinematic feel. If you watch a football game, they typically put it in 60fps+ to make it feel like you’re actually AT the game. Sometimes when movies switch the FPS it can ruin the mood. Out of curiosity, what movie/scene had a harsh transition that ruined the mood for you? Edit: this video illustrates the difference using extreme ends.

Both of my wives (first wife passed, remarried) chose to stay home and raise the kids, but if they had wanted to work I had no issues with that. We lived a ways from family so we just had to do what we had to do. Drive used cars, learn to fix them, change your own oil, eat generic food, don't go out to eat more than once a month or so, exercise, study hard to earn more money and recognize the importance of family so you can rely on each other if things get bad so you don't turn on each other. Today people have forgotten how important family is and why you love each other. Familial love isn't transactional, and I think that's been lost in the modern world. I've been poor, I'm doing very well now but I remember how important family is. Edit - I remembered something. Raise your damn kids. Raising kids doesn't mean just putting up with them, instill solid values like providing for your family, be a good example and teach them how to be better as an adult than you are.

There - you're 2/3 done with your draft! If you're stuck with your outline, make one using MS excel. I find that doing an outline in MS excel helps me focus my thoughts and I can have multiple copies in a work sheet and change things up. It also helps me to organize my foot notes. I number my foot note stickies and place them in the books and then just write them up in order. The footnotes also help me to organize my thoughts. It's something about having squares on the page that helps me focus. Also - set a timer on your phone for 30 minutes. Just spend that 30 minutes thinking about these ideas and how you can use them.

t3_nkpwfy,Your opinion on gender pay gap?,gze7e0f,"It is not a thing and also not legal. Let me tell you a story about my experience, and this is from over 20 years ago. I was working in a machine shop that used machines known as centerless grinders. These machines were quite large and employed two wheels for grinding the parts. One was made of an abrasive composite, think stone, but it had aluminum oxide and ceramic, and the other was a hard rubber. The stone wheel, back then, had a steel core too and weighed in around 120 pounds. Operators were required to change these wheels with no mechanical help, just muscle. There was a woman on my shift that made a lot of money per hour, at least that is what she bragged about and it was significantly higher than what I made. I was forced by the company to change her wheel whenever needed because she was too weak to lift it. My take was, if she cannot perform all of the duties the job required, then why was she there, why did she make a lo more than me, and why was she getting special treatment? If you look at how this gap is presented, the evidence is misrepresented. Women often miss more work than men because of children, or choose to do work that traditionally pays a lower wage.

They include opening and closing parliament, appointing the PM, dissolving parliament, signing bills into laws, etc. The argument is how much power she has to wield those powers on her own. Could she just dissolve parliament, refuse to open it, not sign a bill into law, etc? There are laws that have been passed to limit how much she could but then that brings up the question of how would the courts rule if she decided to use these powers in a way that the parliament and their laws disagree with? So in reality she just does what parliament wants, waves to make the tourists happy and represents the UK internationally as a very hands off Head of State. She is also legally separately the monarch of 15 other countries which have their own laws on how she can act as their Head of State (or who in her place exercises her powers).",952
t3_nlyfb3,ELI5: Why do all stringed musical instruments produce the same notes in the same picking spots?,gzlvtsi,"The overtone series, or harmonics series. Assuming you are referring to the fret location rather than relative pitch between the different strings: Our 12 note Western standard music system is based (approximately) on the overtone series. An open string, let's say E, will vibrate at a wavelength relative to its length. A string (of the same tension) of half the length, or fretted halfway along the length, will produce an E, but up one octave, and it's wavelength will also be half. Now, let's say instead you want to divide that string in 3 (or put a fret along a third of its length): you will produce B in the octave above. Dividing by 4 will be E again (half of a half). Dividing by 5 will produce G#, the major 3rd of the key of E, the reason why a major triad sounds so naturally pleasant to our ears: everything resonates with these relative frequencies within them. The next prime number division, dividing by 7, is the flat 7th of the key. Then a ninth (third of a third) will be an F#, albeit a rather sharp one. Further subdivisions get a bit further away from our Western harmony, for the following reason, which is why I mentioned earlier that this is approximately; Musical instruments based on pure harmony, and exactly following the principles of physics described above, can only play music written in one key. A key a 4th or 5th away is harmonically similar and you may get away with it, but further around the circle of 5ths (circle of 5ths is further reading for our 5 year old, for now take my word for it) will be further removed from the intended relative pitch, and more dissonant to our ears. Some time around the Baroque era (or earlier) someone realised the pitches are pretty close to where they would be if you divided an octave into 12 equal parts, which birthed our 12 pitched ""equal tempered"" music system. Our Baroque friend JS Bach published ""The Well Tempered Clavier"" containing music in all 12 keys, proving that at that time an instrument had been tuned to be able to be played aesthetically in all 12 keys, though doesn't disprove that it may have been done earlier. The equation to get an instrument equal tempered has something to do with the 12th root of 2, but I don't recall how, or have the math skill to understand even if I remembered. Perhaps someone can elaborate so we can have the best educated 5 year olds on the matter.",2375
t3_nlzpsl,ELI5: Why do busses vibrate more when they are not moving?,gzm3rtm,"Reciprocating engines, like the diesel engines in buses, are not perfectly balanced, so they vibrate as they run. The frequency of the vibrations is linked to the speed the engine is running at, in rpm. Structures all have certain frequencies where they will naturally vibrate, for example if you hit them, they will vibrate at a particular frequency (eg ringing a bell). If you forcibly vibrate a structure at a frequency where it naturally vibrates, it will vibrate very strongly, this is called resonance. If you forcibly vibrate a structure at some other frequency, it doesn't vibrate much. For things in buses like body panels, seat structures, grab-poles and the like, their intrinsic natural vibration frequencies are close to the vibrations produced by an engine at idle, so when the engine is at idle, it causes the bus to vibrate. When the engine is under load, it spins at a higher speed, so the vibrations from the engine do not correspond with the natural frequencies of those structures, and they do not vibrate as much.",1034

Make a list of everything you’re better and especially more efficient at and why your time is worth more to the company than it used to be. Don’t be afraid to use numbers. Example: the last time we reviewed my performance, it was taking me an average of 30 minutes to do each report. Since then, I learned to use X software more proficiently and I’m able to do a report in 20 minutes. That’s more than a 30% increase in my output. I realize reports are about 50% of my job requirements so I’d say using only that metric I am at least 15% more valuable to the company. I realize that I need to be a team player and provide value to the organization so I think a fair wage increase would be 10% and the remaining 5% efficiency will be an added benefit to the company.

He said that it would be quick to find me but the rest would be the hard part. I wasn’t supposed to verbally respond at all while they weren’t very close or use the torch unless it got past a certain time. I waited what felt like ages, it got dark. I hadn’t heard them calling out at any point. Despite what I was wearing, I was getting too cold sitting still. It was before the time allowed but I turned my torch on. I felt guilty about that. Nothing. Still nothing. I waved it around and started humming to myself, then singing to myself, then signing loudly. Nothing. I stood up, which would totally wreck the exercise as I wasn’t supposed to be able to stand. Nothing. I shouted and flashed the torch. I kept thinking about whether I should try to work out how to get back toward the car park or not. I wanted to, I knew it was at least uphill. I knew that was probably unwise because moving around would make me even more difficult to find because surely at least my boyfriend knew where I was, he’d said bye and left me there. The time for turning the torch on being allowed came and went. I didn’t have any signal, this was back in the day, I had a mobile phone but they were shot back then, you couldn’t just drop a pin. In the wee hours I heard distant voices and ended up screaming and yelling and flashing the torch at them and they were indeed mountain rescue.

t3_nogbqu,ELI5: how did the roman empire/prussia/idk became modern germany ??,gzzxca7,"The Roman Empire was never particularly solidified in what was then called Germania. The vast majority of the people living there were the ethnic predecessors of what we would call Germans today. After the Roman Empire fell, Frankish tribes centered in Gaul (what we now call France) started extending their authority and rule into Germania and held all the land up to the Rhine. A few hundred years after the fall of the Roman Empire, the Moors began to invade Europe from North Africa through Gibraltar and into Spain. They conquered most of Spain and invaded France. They were doing well until they were defeated at the Battle of Toulouse by a Frankish military leader named Charles Martel. Charles Martel's grandson was renamed Charlemagne and made the Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire was comprised of all the lands held by the Frankish people, including those in Germania. Other powers arose in France and warred with the Merovingian and Carolingian Franks for control of various parts of France. By the middle ages, France was no longer part of the Holy Roman Empire, which was now mostly just Germania. The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806 due to the Napoleonic Wars. Regional powers like Prussia had become stronger than the empire. Now instead of the Empire, there were the various German states, which came together in 1815 and organized themselves as the Confederation of German States. That would go on to become the German empire, which was defeated in WW1 and made into the Weimar Republic, which saw the rise of Hitler and reorganization into the Third Reich, which was defeated in WW2 resulting in democratic West Germany and communist East Germany, which reunified in the late 1980s as Germany.",1728

Mercury is the outlier here it’s over 6 degrees out of plane, if you ignored Mercury the other planets are within I think 2 degrees of the sun. This same planar formation is what we have observed in every solar system that we can see that clearly. The reason is the physics of the solar systems formation. In the most basic way when a solar system forms, the gas cloud that makes it will not be a perfect sphere, it’s irregular shape means that as it collapses it will start to form into shape like a disc with a blob in the centre.

If you mean the closest Planet most for the longest time, it is mercury too. However the Planet that actually gets the closest to us is Venus. 7 Month from now Venus will be as close to us as any planet ever gets and in October last year Mars was closer than any other planet. When you ask what Planet is closest to us right now it is always Mars, Venus or Mercury with Mercury being the answer most often. It all depends on where in their orbits the planets are. If one of them is on the same side of the sun as us and the other two are on the far side of the sun, that is the closest. Mercury has the advantage that even if it is on the far side it is not that much farther away, because it orbits so close to the sun.

t3_n4rkws,ELI5: What does Neanderthal gene sequencing actually tell us about human-Neanderthal interactions? And is there any other evidence of interaction?,gwx6gvo,The first archeological sites where we found Neanderthals they were buried under newer evidence of Homo Sapiens. So the theory was that over time Neanderthals were displaced for Sapiens. However the more sites we found and the more we were able to explore of these sites the more complex things became. We did not just find Neanderthal remains under Sapiens remains but sometimes it was the other way around and sometimes they were buried right next to each other. And this suggests that they were not simply competing with each other and over shared resources but they appeared to be living together in the same caves at the same time. And that is quite uncommon for different species to do. And when we were able to sequence Neanderthal genes we discovered that some of the unique mutations in Neanderthals which were not present in Sapiens at that time are now present in modern day humans. That means that modern humans have some Neanderthal ancestors.

t3_n4sm5p,LPT Request: Does your ability to read improve as you read more? How much (and maybe what) should you read to feel confident if you feel insecure in your ability to read?,gwxj2v7,We were encouraged to read broadsheet newspapers to help with our reading when we were in school. Started out a little bumpy but it improved my ability to read and to understand a wider vocabulary too. The aim I believe was to teach us to understand the meaning of the words in context rather than the sterility of a dictionary and thesaurus. It definitely worked for me. I read a lot even now (15 years since leaving school) and now my daughter follows in my footsteps and reads whatever I've been reading. She started with reading cereal boxes and such and has been reading novels with confidence since she was 8. Definitely would recommend spreading across print formats. Listening to an audible book while following a printed copy can also be useful. Same with using closed captions on the tv. Best of luck in your journey! And as an afterthought....you read through all of this so you're on the right track!,912

t3_n4upn8,"Dear Human Resources managers, what are some things that every employee should know before asking for salary hikes?",gwxnox5,"I have worked in HR most of my professional career. So here are some key points: 1. Your performance will be taken more into consideration, that your tenure. Your argument of ""I have been here 10 years"" will not matter if you are an underperformer. 2. Companies have to take care of internal equity. Just because in other companies are paying more in the same role you have, they can match the salary. If someone in the same position you have (in your current company) makes less than you do, and conditions are equal (performance, Tenure, results etc). Chances are you are not going to get it. 3. Be civilized about it. Demanding and insulting to get it will not work. 4. Make a solid business case on why you deserve a raise. What responsabilities will you take? are you the lowest paid on your team? Is the whole team lower that market? Is the low compensation generating turnover? 5. Having debt, kids or financial problems, are not good arguments. Let me know if this is what you were asking for! Regards.",1010

t3_n4vguw,How do I get my parents to unterstand why I did sex work?,gwxqxqw,Your parents are deflecting. People handle situations differently. Some parents own up to the fact they weren't good parents and try to support their kids. Some parents take their guilt of f***ing up and direct all their guilt and blame to an easy target (you). They won't change their mindset that easily. This is an ego issue. They don't want to admit that they didn't really notice your problems and tried to live ignorantly. It is easier to blame you as a kid. I would try not to focus on asking for the improbable expecting people who are unempathetic to be empathetic. It would be better to continue to find help in an empathetic environment.,648

Just recognize the yearning for what it is and then pursue your hobbies. I have so many hobbies and interests that I rarely make time for friends because I quite enjoy my own company and doing the things I love to do (some people may consider me selfish because of this, but I feel quite fulfilled).

Marx was very adamant about how the crux of the problems with the capitalist mode of production were located in production not in distribution. That was the core of his disagreement with Proudhon.

t3_n6bdsb,I absolutely hate sharing anything. Don’t even look at my food. Why am I like this and how can I fix it?,gx6433i,"There’s nothing wrong with wanting your things to belong with you. Having a tight grip on your stuff doesn’t necessarily make you selfish; that stems more from what you are able to give away but refuse to. Giving your time away is a good act. Sometimes giving money to someone in need. You don’t have to share your car or sandwich to be a kind person. If you see it as a possible confrontational issue with someone (maybe it already was before) then just try to ponder what the worse outcome could be if it happens. Someone taking your car could run it off the road. But if someone borrowed something like a basketball, what’s the worst that can happen. You don’t have an obligation to lend out anything of yours, but maybe stressing less about can help ease any difficulty you face. Good luck!",794

Headphone jacks are very convenient, you can still use them while something else is plugged into the type c USB port, such as a charging cable. There's also the fact that wired headphones are often times much better quality than the shitty wireless ones typically available. A decent quality wired headphones will be significantly cheaper than wireless ones of the same quality. Also, on the topic of audio quality, you don't have to worry about interference or other things impacting audio quality or introducing strange artifacts like you do with wireless headphones. To most people none of this matters, they just care whether or not they can hear something or not. But for me I enjoy quality and once you know what quality is like it's hard to go back.",762

Figuring out how much sleep youre willing to lose sometimes to meet one anothers needs, and finding ways to enjoy one another. Scheduling everything.. etc My binational fiance works a lot. I message him throughout the day whilst im working. Just small things like ""Yay now im getting breakfast!"". It helps me feel closer to him, and he enjoys the read. He does the same for me just less when im the one working or out for the day. Investing in a bond touch might also help with a ""im thinking of you!"" throughout the day. We've been long distance for two years now, we're working on immigrating me to the US with him which will take about another year and a half. It definitely isnt easy, and sometimes it will stagnate. But I also think that's okay. I think its okay if some days were not as romantic or some days we dont focus on one another enough. Relationships have phases, flowing in and out of them naturally.

They don’t completely block out the noise, but they kind of take the edge off so you don’t get woken up so much. HOWEVER, you might not want to do this when you’re home alone. It’s probably okay if you share the house with family, but if you’re alone you don’t want to run the risk of sleeping through an alarm.

t3_n7wt1o,ELI5: Old cities have been excavated that are covered in soil from years of neglect/abandonment. Sometimes from quite deep underground. Where does the soil come from?,gxf761b,"There are many sources. The first layers of dirt is usually from the collapsing buildings themselves. The walls, roofs and furniture will collapse and rot creating a layer of debris that covers most thing. In some cases there are city fires speeding up the process. A lot of buildings also tends to be built on top of older buildings which have collapsed or burned so even a city that is being lived inn will grow upwards covering the older parts of the city with newer buildings. But there are also a lot of other things that cause cities to be buried further and further. Winds blow harder on mountain tops and erodes away the soil and rock which then gets deposited in the valleys where there is not as much wind. Similarly rivers carries dirt and sediments from the steeper mountains where the water flows fast and deposits them on the planes where the rivers are much calmer. Especially during floods a lot of soil is carried from the mountains down into the valleys where the cities are.",993

How they work is as simple as it sounds. They make a new account (or hijack one) and follow the account they've been told to follow. That's usually it. There's also reply bots, share bots, like bots... they function very similarly to Reddit bots, coded to do one or two things.

If you think a workmate is becoming a friend, well, that's OK - but keep that stuff outside the office/workplace. It's not so much about keeping what you say to a minimum, I reckon it's just about wearing that ""I'm at work"" hat. So measure your responses for appropriateness and stick to it, almost as if you're dealing with a customer. You'll get the hang of it really fast. If you want to be a professional person and succeed, you try not to get angry at customers, or tell them your downstairs area is itchy, or ask if they've ever fantasized about their mother .. reserve that stuff for friends at home ;) Sounds like you're just a little too authentic for your own good.",1042

Your first misunderstanding is the scope and scale of research papers. No professor, mentor, or department head expects you to attempt to compress the entire history of an idea or the entire idea even, in a research paper or journal article. In my major, when we carry out research for a paper or a topic, we tend to focus on one aspect of something. For example, we might want to write a paper on the history of Hangul. Well, you would agree that it would be very difficult to contribute anything meaningful to your field if had to somehow compress the entire history of Hangul in 30 pages (very rarely have I seen a scholarly article exceed 35ish pages). Instead, you might write about how women popularized the Hangul script through letter writing. The same approach is usually taken for research papers. In theses and dissertations (I have read quite a bit), people usually can go into a bit more detail and cover a more broad topic, but still only focus on something specific. I imagine that all humanities and social sciences operate on the same principles.",1241

t3_nah70u,"If moral error theory turned out to be true, would the way we live our lives be any different?",gxtnc5u,"This exact line of reasoning is what led me to leave moral realism and become some kind of expressivist - because I know quite a couple of error theorists and they're all just as moral as the next person, and all seem to understand that even though they think error theory is true, it is still wrong to harm others, steal, etc. While i was a moral realist, I was becoming progressively more convinced of error theory (mostly for queerness reasons). But when I thought - 'error theory is true, therefore 'it is wrong to harm others' is false' and started contemplating the pragmatic consequences of this - that I had no reasons other than prudence not to harm others - I always felt 'but I still have reason not to harm others'. I realised that even if I became convinced of error theory, I would still feel, think and act as if I had a reason not to harm others. There are a couple of ways to interpret the feeling that 'even if error theory is true, harming others is still wrong'. The first is that its just a mistake - moral habit prevents us from implementing the consequences of our beliefs. Just as thinking 'I shouldn't want cigarettes' doesn't make the cravings go away, accepting error theory doesn't make one amoral (its worth saying that error theory doesn't endorse immorality either - it just rejects that normativity exists in any strong sense, so it doesn't 'endorse' anything). I rejected this line of reasoning because I think for a belief to seriously count as a full belief it has to have consequences for how we reason and how we act, and error theory doesn't seem to have any such consequences. Another interpretation of this is fictionalism, which endorses error theory, but says that moral concepts are still \*useful\*. They are like mythic stories used to predict seasons or the rain, or that teach children lessons and make us all behave. They are false, strictly speaking, but they serve some purpose. Again, this struck me as unsatisfying, as it provides no prohibition against abandoning morality if one finds it no longer useful. But my experience of morality is that it is non-optional - that its norms still apply to you even if you don't believe in them and choose to ignore them. Anyway, at the end of the day the fact that even if i became convinced that moral facts don't exist \~out there in the world\~ my behaviour, practical reasoning, and the way I feel the normative force of morality, wouldn't change convinced me that moral facts aren't supposed to exist \~out there\~ (which both the error theorist and moral realist accept) but somehow emerge out of what it is to be human and the ways we interact with each other. It helped at the time that I was becoming a global expressivist in phil of language, and started seeing all linguistic behaviour as normative, so it was easier to abandon spooky, queer normativity in favour of normativity of a more mundane sort that arises out of being the kind of creatures that we are. Bit of a ramble but I guess I'm saying I think its a great question that leads to very interesting philosophical places.",3086

t3_nb0tg2,ELI5: Why is the jaw the best place to punch someone if you're trying to knock them out?,gxxwb8r,"The jaw isn't the *best* place but it's a vulnerable place nonetheless. This is because it's fleshy compared to the rest of the head. The temples of the head are rigid and connected to the jaw, and the skull is very thick, thick enough that it can actually break a person's hand if they attempt to hit it. The jaw is different. Above/adjacent the jaw there's a hollow opening (the mouth), and it's filled with air and soft muscle which offers little resistance to force. In other words, it's the soft underbelly of the head. This is bad news for the recipient of the punch. Their head will go from one position to another very quickly causing the brain to crash against the skull (unconciousness). That being said, knocking someone out is very dangerous and should really only be a last resort in a fight. It's not as simple as the movies show it to be.",853

Who is in the wrong?",gy4rqny,"I don't know who's in the wrong exactly. Technically if you signed the HOA agreement then you are subject to it's rules like any contract. For teaching the kids to drive, you can just drive off the HOA property and then let them get in the driver's seat. While it isn't on the HOA property, you can still teach them to drive. Most parents that I know of start teaching their kids by taking them to an empty parking lot and then letting them drive from there anyway. There are some workarounds I can see for your problem though. Option 1, store the kid's cars off the HOA property. Then the kids can drive to and from work and then walk to and from the area where they park their cars. So long as the kids can legally drive anyway. Option 2, attempt to change the rule. You pay your dues, you have every right to go to the meetings, ask questions, and propose rule changes. You will have to get this through your HOA committee, but I could easily see you getting the rule changes or getting an exemption. Talk to your HOA, you literally pay them for the right to do that. Option 3, drive the kids outside the property, then let them drive the car while you walk back home. When they come home, walk out to the edge of the property and then drive it back in. From what I can see, and my experience with my own HOA, since you signed the HOA agreement you have to follow their rules. You can try to change those rules or you can work around those rules, but breaking any rules means you can legitimately be fined and it will be a legally binding fine. Best of luck to you.",1568

t3_ndm7o8,ELI5: Why do we not have a household appliance to cool food quickly?,gybgrvn,"When you heat things up, you can apply a very strong heat difference. For instance, when you boil an egg, you put it in water that is about 75-100 deg. centigrade hotter than the egg's original temperature. That's gonna heat the egg pretty quickly. Or when you bake something in an oven, it's not hard to get a temperature differential of more than 200 centigrade. Again, that's gonna raise the temperature of your dish rather fast. If you could put something in a -200 degree freezer, it would cool down pretty quickly too. Trouble is, it's hard to make a freezer that cold. Your fridge runs at about 4 centigrade, and home freezers go to maybe -20. Expensive medical-grade freezers (e.g. the ones used for some of the corona-vaccines) might go down to below -70, and it's possible to go even colder but it gets harder and more expensive. Basically, lots of simple chemical reactions (e.g. burning) and physical processes (e.g. running electricity through a wire) generate heat, whereas drawing heat away is a much less ""natural"" process. You definitely can speed the cooling process up though, even with the small temperature gradients that are available in home settings. Let's say you're wanting to cool down a can of soda. One thing that will really help is to immerse the can in ice water, since water is a much better heat conductor than air. If you can keep the water moving around, that helps too, as this will replace water that's been warmed by the can with colder water. So in theory, you could make an ice-water-circulator appliance for quickly cooling down drinks. The demand for such a product would be very small, though, as you can achieve a very similar effect with some ice cubes and a bucket when the need arises, and most of the time you can just avoid this issue completely by storing your drinks in the fridge ahead of time. It's also not clear how to make this a particularly convenient product, unless it's hooked up to a water source as well as a water drainage system (otherwise it's not really better than a bucket, only with some kind of fan or pump to keep the water moving automatically).",2119

If you want MY answer: I never lash out on those who are uninvolved because, well.. they’re UNINVOLVED, lol, so that wouldn’t be fair or reasonable or logical, and those are core values to me, so I guess my body just knows not to break those core values. But generally when I’m angry, what I usually do is vent my frustrations the MOMENT I’m feeling frustrated (if I’m with people though, I mitigate it by just venting in my head, or I negate my venting and save it to vent over later, but) that way the frustration doesn’t build up and make my overall day shitty/cause me to lash out at someone.

t3_nf0po3,Question: How to get started with philosophy?,gyj9gm8,"Hey there! It seems to me like it would help if we split this into **three possible scenarios:** being interested in philosophy as a whole, being interested in a specific topic, or being interested in a specific author. **Scenario 1:** If you're interested in philosophy as a whole, but you have no idea where to start, you can look over the different sub-topics of philosophy and see what you find interesting based on the sorts of questions it asks. Here are some (very) broad examples: Ethical/moral philosophy tries to answer questions like: *""What is moral, or good?""*, *""Where does morality come from?""*, and *""Is morality objective or subjective/relative?""*. Metaphysics tries to answer questions like: *""What exists?""*, *""What is this stuff that exists like?"",* *""Why does anything exist at all?""*, and *""Could things have been different? Could nothing have existed at all?""* Aesthetics, which deals with beauty, art, etc., pursues questions like: *""What makes something beautiful?""*, *""What is beauty?""*, *""How do we decide what does or doesn't count as art?""*, and more. If this approach doesn't seem like your style, maybe watch a [philosophy video series on Youtube](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/comments/7o6pm0/what_are_some_good_philosophy_youtube_channels/), or listen to [a philosophy podcast.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/comments/4i0faz/what_are_some_good_philosophy_podcasts/) A lot of them cover philosophy from start to finish (that's a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the idea) in a very approachable and understandable way. **Scenario 2:** If you're interested in a specific topic of philosophy, consider reading the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP)](https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html) article on that topic or reading a fundamentals/introduction type book on it. For example, I once took a class on the philosophy of mind, and I still have this book called *~~The Fundamentals of Ethics~~* ~~by Russ Schafer-Landau~~ (edit: I meant to say *Philosophy of Mind: A Contemporary Introduction* by John Heil) that I think is a great summary of the different theories of mind, and the arguments for and against them. **Scenario 3:** If you have a particular philosopher in mind that you want to get into, you can look into whatever books they've written that most appeal to you. Nietzsche, for example, has *Thus Spoke Zarathustra*, which is a novel. In a completely different style, he also has *Beyond Good and Evil*, which takes the form of many (relatively) short aphorisms, sort of like a list of bullet points. Pick what works for you based on the style and topic, or just look up what most people start with for that philosopher. Best of luck! Edit: Improved formatting. Edit 2: Added links to r/AskPhilosophyFAQ posts about Youtube channels and podcasts about philosophy. --- P.S.

t3_nf37lx,What common exercising mistake do people make?,gyjhjqo,"1 tip to me that I see a lot of people do is that they stick to a routine and keep it, and let me clarify why I think it’s bad. They will set themselves to lift a certain amount and for a certain amount of sets/reps. Sure that’s good for week 1 but for the next push it by adding more weight or more sets/reps. People will continue to do the same workout every time and expect huge results. Your body is accustomed to the regular routine if you just do the same thing. When I was loosing weight I did the same thing for like a month and I burned some but then had no muscle growing, after that I increased my weights and sets/reps and the muscle kicks in.

Now if that's all your questions, have a nice day"" and hung up on me. On the flip side of that coin, I've called our other local vet and had a very pleasant and light hearted conversation with their receptionist, so it's definitely a gamble on what you're going to get, and usually (from what I've learned) if the receptionist is snarky and bitchy like that, then its a pretty good guess that the other staff members are just like them.",817

It had a content warning in it, which is what really drew me to it because I had only seen that once before. It was super boring and did not justify that warning. The twist is at the end ruins the whole book. It leaves a ton of random things unexplained. I know plenty of good books so that so you can speculate but here it just feels like the author just forgot. The Phantom of Manhattan by Fredrick Forsyth: It’s a sequel of The Phantom of the Opera musical. The plot moves really slowly for most of the book than crams a ton of stuff in the last 50 pages. The plot is pretty ridiculous and it ruins most of the characters development from the musical. The also fridge Christine, which I really didn’t appreciate. Breaking Dawn by Stephanie Meyer: Yeah I know, I really shouldn’t have expected much. I found the rest to be entertaining though. It’s both the strangest and most boring thing I’ve ever read. It’s the longest book in the series but somehow almost nothing happens. They spent the whole series building up these bad guys. Several hundred pages are dedicated to preparing for the final battle.

Your pop distracts everyone from the lesson, distracts the teacher's train of thought, etc. Also, many teachers hate kids snacking during class because now you are focused more on your treat than you are the lesson at hand. If you are going to eat, eat something that is quiet, something that doesn't smell too much, and open it quietly. Don't be a distraction. Teachers don't have to allow kids to snack.

Good reviews, good games, not being hated on by the internet, not having your favourite games bashed on because someone on YouTube said so, not having to deal with loud cringy fans, etc. People like IGN, Watch Mojo, Zero Punctuation loves to mock us, make fun of us, laugh at us and constantly talk about Sonic 06 and Sonic BOOM as if that's the only Sonic games that exists. Meanwhile they keep on singing praises of Nintendo and they hardly ever say anything bad about them. They also talk shit about my favourite games, being extremely nit pickings and saying a game is bad for hypocritical reasons (So Link turns into a Wolf and nobody blinks. But when Sonic does it everyone goes crazy) and [some game revieiwers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBHC99ZkdWI) show that they can't play the game.

And the worst part is that people will believe them. Nintendo fans don't have to deal with it as they get good reviews and everything left right and center Also people love to make fun that there are ""too many Sonic characters"" and make fun of our cringy fandom (that is only 10% of our population), while there are fandoms that are worse. and our last game was Sonic forces, while Mario fans got Mario Odyssey and Zelda fans got Breath of the Wild. In fact almost all of our (Sonic games) last games in the last 20 or so years are outclassed or not held up to standard or was overshadowed by a Nintendo game. The only time we had a game that was held up to be just as good was in the 90's. Now, we would be lucky if our game was an honorable mention in the ""Top 20 games of the year"".

t3_nicfal,Short stories or a Novella?,gz188lv,"Definitely try to stretch your limits with a novella, especially if you want to publish longer works in the future. The only way to really get better at writing longer works is by writing longer works. If your only goal is publishing, I'd caution you, though. It's a difficult path to be traditionally published, or to earn even a modicum of success in self-publishing or traditional publishing. If you leap into writing these works with the sole objective of publication, and you find yourself getting rejected, it will feel more like a failure, in my experience. Writing anything is incredibly difficult, and merely finishing a novel, novella, or short story that you're satisfied with is an incredible accomplishment. Don't sweat it if you don't get published from the get go. Most writers who started writing young didn't publish a book until their 30's, so you've got plenty of time to work on your craft. If I were you, I would look into literary magazines as well, especially if you have some short stories you're proud of. It's still super difficult to get a story published, but less so than a collection or novella. Traditional publishers aren't super keen on short story collections or novellas. That doesn't mean you shouldn't write them, that just means publishing is doubly difficult. Short story publications for literary magazines will help you get used to rejections on a smaller scale, make connections, and get an understanding for how editors, publishers, and the literary world works. Most writers got their start publishing in magazines, and there's a ton online to look into. Hope that helps, and good luck with your writing!",1648

It could simply be some peoples fate to have a talking Stand. On the other hand, Stand powers seem to always fit a persons needs, will, or obsessions. Maybe some people just need a stand that can talk back. Pocolocco needed a hype man to get him to believe in his own luck. Trish needed someone to give her the confidence to fight.

It was especially common to bet marbles on games, ostensibly making the playground a soft casino. It was actually pretty savage and resulted in a lot of confrontations which is ultimately why it was all shut down and marbles had to be banned. I was part of the reason for that. So I was playing against someone that I thought I could beat. I couldn't. And after a few games I was in debt pretty badly. I was hustled. And he immediately started to threaten me to cough up so I had to buy time. So I scrambled, I gathered marbles, I hustled a bunch of kids in turn. I even borrowed marbles from my friend and didn't tell him that I was using them to pay back someone else. And these were marbles he liked, a couple were quite distinct. So I pay the guy back and it is after school. My friend comes and notices this other guy using his marbles and asks for them back. The one with them argues they are now his. My friend says no they are mine. They get increasingly in each other's faces. Meanwhile I slowly ghost into the background. My friend kicked the god damn shit out of the hustler and got his marbles back. I don't know if he ever truly connected the dots, I don't really think he cared. And the scary part?

t3_nkevmw,Should I submit my paper to an undergraduate journal or a graduate journal?,gzdfvej,"The most mileage you are ever going to get out of a paper written as an undergrad/ first-year MA is publication in an undergraduate journal. That could help you with PhD admissions in a couple of ways: (1) it's a nice thing to have had a paper published in an undergraduate journal, even though it certainly will not guarantee you admission to a great PhD program, and (2) if you include the link to the essay on your CV, it will give the admissions committee another piece of your writing to look at besides the sample of your academic work that you will submit with your application. Sneaky, yes, and no guarantee that the admissions committee will read it, but perfectly okay to do. Publishing in a graduate student journal while in a PhD program, on the other hand, will accomplish very little. While in a PhD program, students usually aim to publish in regular, discipline-specific scholarly journals. I can assure you, as the director of an MA program and with absolutely no insult intended, that while this particular essay might be terrific for an undergrad/first-year MA student, it will definitely not be up to par with the PhD-student work one sees in grad student journals, and it will not even be in the ballpark of what one sees in regular journals.

t3_nkx4p3,How to get better at listening to other people's opinion?,gzg7yfn,"In addition to mindfulness, learn and establish some emotional regulation techniques to soothe yourself when you're in uncomfortable situations. Take some time to reflect back on the feelings, thoughts, patterns etc that come up emotionally when you're in a disagreement/ listening to opposing views. If you take time to reflect on past experiences and habits, you can pick up on the signs of stress, anxiety, fear, anger etc in your body early on and soothe yourself before it takes over. It could be possible that disagreements bring up issues of self-worth and not belonging (which are normal fears). Perhaps you have past experiences in which you've been criticized, made to feel less than (e.g. intellectually), were rejected etc for having different thoughts. Perhaps differences were modelled to be a negative thing in significant past experiences. Whatever the case, it's a protective mechanism for you. If you can understand the root cause and treat it (soothe yourself, work on your inner self-worth and belonging), you'll be better equip to truly treat the issue. Good on you and good luck mate!",1106
t3_nl098l,When was a time where you were really lucky?,gzfujsv,"My wife and I were moving from Iowa to Minnesota. She already had a job in the Twin Cities, I was in about to have an interview with a company there. But she hadn't found an apartment. Part of the problem is that we had four cats, and most places only accepted two cats. While I was up one weekend, we did see a For Rent sign on an apartment building near what's now Bde Maka Ska. It was a nice place, would accept cats. We called the landlord to set up a viewing, and he said his wife had been after him to rent it. He said he'd be there Saturday at some time...and he wasn't. He wasn't at his home around the corner, either. So we called and he said he'd be there the next morning at ten. Again, he wasn't there. We were dispirited, and decided to just start driving towards where my wife works, and see what we could find; we'd resigned ourselves to buying a house. We found an open house, a split-level style that I don't like, but as we entered the previous people were leaving, so the real estate agent had us all to ourselves. We explained that we had professional jobs (I was waiting from the place that interviewed me to see if they could place me before hiring me), no kids, were just moving to the area, but we couldn't find an apartment because we had four cats. She didn't tell us that we could have whatever pets we wanted in a house. She didn't tell us that mortgage payments meant building equity, instead of paying rent to someone. She didn't talk about how good rates were now, and getting a house meant investing for the future. Instead, she said, ""I passed by an apartment complex on my way in today, that had a 'Pets Welcome' sign, now where was that?"" She gave us directions to where she recalled, and we drove down and found the place. Sure enough, there was such a sign, and we went to the rental office. The woman who met us said, in response to us mentioning that we have four cats, ""Oh, that's no problem, we have a cat building."" She took us to an apartment there, very nice, that needed to be sublet because the guy there with two cats was moving away. So, we went back to the office to fill in an application, and sign a lease. The application fee was cheap, but so was the damage deposit; it was much less than one month's rent. But as I was reading through the lease, I found a section saying pets were prohibited. ""Oh, you're in the cat building, so it's implied."" ""Well, let's make it explicit, and add in that we have four cats that are allowed."" She called over to another worker in the rental office, who said, ""They can only have two cats."" Our woman looked at our checks for the damage deposit and the application fee, then said she'd talk to the manager. She came back, and said, ""OK, you can have the four cats, but you'd have to pay the pet deposit for each of them."" The pet deposit was about $200, and they always said they'd keep one quarter of it when we moved out. Since the damage deposit and this quadrupled pet deposit were a month's rent, it wasn't unreasonable, so we signed the lease, and had a place to live. Three years later, we bought a house. Our closing was mid-December, so we planned to clean up the apartment after we moved out. We contacted the office to close everything up, and ask for what we needed to clean. ""Oh, we have to do that anyway; when are you moving?"" ""Well, we've already moved out."" ""Oh! In that case, you qualify for a program, you'll get your whole deposit back, because we can schedule people to clean and paint and such before the end of the month."" When she saw our deposit, her eyes went wide. In Minnesota, there's interest you earn on your deposits, and since we had such a big deposit, we got a big payout...and we got all of it, and didn't have to clean up after we moved out.",3766
t3_nl2tk2,How do you know if someone is lying about a sitation?,gzgb3yl,"The story will either be *too vague* or *too detailed*. If the liar is the vague kind, push for details and watch the reaction closely. Look for signs of openness and surprise, versus discomfort and disinterest. This kind of lie is harder to detect in the first place, but falls apart more easily. If the liar is the detailed kind, try to record them, or at least keep very careful tabs on the story they are telling and compare it to facts you are sure about. Try to find a logical or factual error the story they are telling you. This kind of lie can be easier to spot (just feels off) but harder to unravel, so take your time. Look for corroborating evidence if needed. Have them retell the story several times and watch them closely. Let the errors add up (if possible). Be sure you have caught someone in a lie and want a confrontation about it before telling someone you think they lied.",893
t3_nl5igo,How does Slavoj Zizek's Lacanian Marxism work?,gzi8c2d,"Flippantly, I would say that ""Lacanian Marxism"" is just a slightly different way of saying Althusserianism. Althusser is definitely the intersection point of Marx and the kind of French structuralist milieu that Lacan was prominent in. You'll probably want someone well-read in Althusser, who I am not, to identify more thoroughly his reading of Marx and how that emerges in Zizek's presentation of Marx. Zizek's line on ideology as a kind of symbolic field that immediately structures our subjectivity is due to Althusser, and so if you do indeed watch *The Pervert's Guide to Ideology* this is the kind of ideology he's talking about. I can brush up on my Althusser (and my Althusser as it pertains to Zizek) quickly and come back, but I hope for now this gives you a direction in which to start looking. Zizek edited a compendium called *Mapping Ideology* which deals with... well, you know, so that'll give you a bit of a spread of authors relevant to this kind of idea.",974

t3_nlp6tg,What type of third-person narrator should I aspire to be?,gzk19x8,"Personally I like it when the narrator has a character of their own when they're nor a part of the actual story. It could be done by the narrator having opinions on the situation or just simply having a very distinct voice. Neutral narrators are boring af. An opinionated narrator feels like an actual humab being telling you a story, another character to explore, something interesting in the text during some more boring parts of the story itself. There's so much cool stuff you can do with a not neutral narrator! The only thing to remember is to stay consistant and not to preach too much. Share an opinion and move on, don't give your readers a lecture on morals. And I honestly don't see how giving an opinion on character's actions would keep the readers from having their own opinions. You don't have to agree with the narrator just as you don't have to agree with a character. I think if being a more biased narrator is more natural to you, you should work on perfecting that instead of trying to force yourself into a more neutral tone that would be harder for you to maintain.",1087

When a cable is plugged in, the power delivery pins are set to 5V, 2A, 10W. Then other pins receive a message that indicates the version of the protocol. In the first version, a device then sends a message that indicates which one of the five profiles to change to (the sixth was unused). These are specific power delivery amounts - 10W, 18W, 36W, 60W, 100W. The second version of the standard allows the device to select a specific voltage (5V, 9V, 15V, 20V), and then provides a way to fine tune the wattage from there. The messages allow 0.5W changes to the power delivered. The third version allows even finer grain control. The messages allow 20 mV changes to the power delivered. The fourth version, the new one, allows a larger range of voltages up to 50V to be selected. The other device has the opportunity to say it doesn't support the version requested. The devices will see if they both support each version, newest to oldest, until they can agree on a version or the basic 10W is used.",1061

t3_nmx0jq,ELI5: What is dungeons and dragons?,gzr4khq,"It is a tabletop role playing game set in a fantasy world. Players create a character, using a character sheet to record their skills and achievements and progress. There are different classes to choose from, like warrior, thief, mage, archer, and more. Each one plays differently. There's a bit of theater to it. One player is the Dungeon Master who creates and narrates the story that the other players are playing through. The other players, in the role of their characters, advance through the story. Unlike video games or other board games with really strict rules, D&amp;D encourages creativity and quick thinking, and you can go ""off script"" and do whatever you want to most of the time (as long as the Dungeon Master allows it). Probably the most famous parts of D&amp;D are the morality system (playing as a good, neutral, or evil character), and rolling dice to complete skill checks (say your character has level 3 lockpicking and there's a lock that is level 2, but you're drunk so your ability is impaired a little bit... you roll a dice to see if you're successful or not. This goes for *every* encounter in the game, from trying to persuade someone through speech to attacking rats with swords). If you've ever played a video game RPG, then it's most likely had some sort of D&amp;D mechanic implemented in it, especially the skill check system (though video games usually resolve this automatically for you). The most popular games that are based on/inspired by D&amp;D are the Baldur's Gate series, Neverwinter Nights and Pillars of Eternity, but there are many others.",1586

First, what people are saying about sleeping outside of your circadian rhythm is true. Your body has a sleep cycle it likes to adhere to, you can sleep outside of it, but it's almost always significantly worse in quality. However, what most of people are claiming to affect circadian rhythm is actually pretty shallow research. Certain things seem to be more important than others, like exposure to daylight; but the problem is that there isn't one overarching indicator. People just respond to too many different variables in too many different ways to have a completely successful measure on it. What causes your own circadian rhythm isn't always so simple.

t3_no5fn8,My dads been a mechanic for 40+ years and has always told me to never change transmission fluid in a car even if the manufacture recommends changing it at certain miles. Is not changing the fluid actually some mechanic secret or is he just stubborn?,gzyctiw,"If he's an experience mechanic and this advice comes from his own experience, he should be able to briefly explain why changing transmission fluid is a bad idea. In fact one would expect he'd enjoy explaining it. If he can't or won't explain why this is, then most likely he learned it from someone else whom he respected, or else he had bad experience with a narrow range of transmissions some time in the distant past. The truth is that automobile technology has come LONG way in 40 years. In fact it has come a long way in just the last 20. Manufacturers state the maintenance intervals for a reason, they don't just distill the maintenance schedules from thin air. If you can't get any info out of your dad, I'd ask your regular mechanic when or if the car is scheduled to have the transmission fluid changed, and whether they have any opinion on the matter, and go with whoever has the more convincing story. Edit: a couple of other points come up if you search for ""don't change transmission fluid"" on the internet. (A) if you wait until long after the scheduled fluid change, then changing it later may stir up the accumulated sediments, distribute them around the transmission, and cause a failure. (B) an experienced mechanic can look at the fluid that's in your transmission and tell you (by its color, viscosity, and any sediment present) whether it's past due for a change. The normal way to avoid this is to change it on schedule; and if you don't follow the schedule or if you never change the fluid at all, the transmission will likely fail sooner than its design lifetime.",1588

Not long enough to take you out for very long but it happens sometimes. Learning to handle to pain was part of the training. (For example: early on for my yellow belt test I had to fight 3 people at a time for two hours. He kept switching people out so I would keep being suprised. The aim was survive, and not submit.

I felt I wasnt getting the same training as I used to get. So started working as a ppo and debt collector for not so nice people and used my art to complete jobs. My sensei found out and told me that I was dishonoring our dojo by using dark martial arts for something other than self defense or protection of others. I thought he had dishonored our dojo by changing our traditional ways to pander to new students who didnt want to learn the traditional way. We disagreed and I left. Now I realise he was right.

t3_n3dt21,ELI5: How does the undo feature work in collaborative applications such as Google Docs?,gwphryk,"[Chuktropolis Welling Moran of UC San Diego](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8kg6q723) explains that different programs implement an undo feature in different ways. Recently, the undo button has evolved to accommodate collaborative text-editing systems, such as Google Docs. So what goes on under the hood? Before we learn about how a computer keeps track of undo, we must understand what a stack is. A stack is a way of storing data, where new data is added on top of old data, and the most recently added data will be removed first. This is analogous to a pile of books: the most recently added book will be on top, and it will be the first to be removed. Many implementations of undo use stacks. [Max Lynch,](https://gist.github.com/mlynch/ab554d84dc3b7b8be3d6) the CEO of Ionic Foundation, describes the undo function as a stack of operations that the user has performed. In other words, it is the ""history"" of the actions the user has taken. Whenever the user does an action, we add the action to the undo stack. When the user wishes to undo something, each action is taken out of the undo stack. Think back to the pile of books but now imagine someone wants a book in the middle. They wouldn't want to topple the pile to get the book from the middle. Instead, they would remove each book off the top of the stack, undoing what they did, until they reach the book they need. Collaborative applications implement the undo feature in a more dynamic way using stacks. In the case of [Google Docs](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/google-docs.htm), the program keeps a copy of the document on each user’s computer, and sends each change a user makes to a central server. The central server then sends a signal to all of the other users to implement the change on their copy of the document. When someone undoes an action in Google Docs, the local stack of actions on that user’s computer removes the last action. Then, that change is sent to the central server, and the data on all copies of the document are updated to reflect the undo action. The main challenge that arises when implementing this is users making changes at the same time. This could cause a number of problems, including changes being applied to the document in the wrong order. To mitigate this, [Google Drive Blog](https://drive.googleblog.com/2010/09/whats-different-about-new-google-docs_22.html) states that Google Docs implements a technique called operational transformation. In his academic [paper](https://www.ijstr.org/final-print/jan2016/Operational-Transformation-In-Co-operative-Editing.pdf), Mandeep Kaur describes operational transformation as an algorithm that “transforms” the changes being received from others relative to each user’s document. This transformation is done so that the change can be completed without editing the rest of the document. The inner workings of this algorithm are very complex, but it essentially ensures that when users make simultaneous changes, these changes (including undo) happen in the correct order. TLDR: the undo function is a list of actions that is stored on the computer. When the user either clicks on the undo button or does “Ctrl + Z/Cmd + Z” on their keyboard, it removes the most recent action in the list. In collaborative applications, there is a local list of actions on each user’s computer which can be used to undo the latest action of the user. Processes such as Operational Transform apply these changes in a central server and merge actions to create simultaneous undo actions.",3539

I think your BF was mostly upset because he had a rare short day at work, and he hoped to spend at least part of his unexpected free time with you. It's unfortunate that it happened on the same day as your friend's birthday, but I can understand why he would feel that you prioritized spending time with her rather than with him.

The job of a welfare program isn't to lift people out of poverty. It's to help people in poverty keep their head above water while they find another job or do whatever they have to do. I don't have the stats in front of me, but IIRC about half of people who apply for and receive welfare are back on their own within six months, with 90% on their own within two years. The reason poverty levels don't change is because as someone leaves, someone else enters. The issue is that we live in a system that requires poverty. The solution is... Well, something we've been discussing since the 19th century. Some say reform the system, some say tear down and rebuild the system, some say just suck it up and hope you're in the upper echelons of the system. The latter tends to be the group in power.",874

t3_n3yh6t,"Eli5 space-time continuum for a dummy, does it physically exist or is it just a mathematical model created to picturise gravity?",gwsnjzf,"We use models to explain things. We might hold up a ping pong ball and say, this is like the earth. We might then put a toothpick through the ping pong ball to show how the earth rotates. We might use a flashlight to represent the sun, and then tilt the toothpick to represent the poles, etc. Sometimes we use a two-dimensional model of a three-dimensional thing. For instance a drawing that shows a farm house in the foreground, a barn in the middle ground, and tiny cows in the background. We can also use a three-dimensional model to represent a four-dimensional thing like showing how a cube can unfold into six connected squares and then show eight cubes in a cross and explain that this is what a hyper-cube looks like when it is unfolded into three-dimensional space. How do these models relate to space time? Well space-time is a four-dimensional construct. it contains within it 3d of space and 1d of time. We can't easily represent 4d items to our 3d brains. We can ""prove"" that space time compresses and expands and works in relation to speed on any arbitrary reference point (General relativity / gravity) but we have a hard time explaining it because we don't have any ""good"" ways of visualizing it. Now ""does it exist or is it just math?"" is a really big question. Every PHYSICAL TEST we have come up with and every MATHEMATICAL TEST we have come up with say that our MODEL of relativity MATCHES what we can test for in REALITY. BUT is it ""REAL"" ??? Science can never say for certain that something is REAL. We can only come up with better and better models. For instance we used to accept that Newton's idea of Gravity was ""REAL"" because we had no tests that we could conduct that said it wasn't. Then we found some tests that showed newton's Model for how gravity work failed to take into account things moving near the speed of light. His model broke down there, but Einstein's model doesn't break down. In fact Einstein found the math first, and then we developed the physical tests much later. Is the current ""Theory"" or accepted law, about gravity 100% correct. No. It breaks down at the quantum level. So maybe there is a better model out there that will more more closely fit all aspects of reality. But is the model of gravity we have right now including space-time accepted as ""REAL"" for anything larger than the quantum scale? Yes.",2356

There is also a statistical probability that we are closer to the end. Given how fast the population has grown, how many people have lived before us, and how many are living now, and how many will be living in a hypothetical future, the odds on you randomly being born in that 'elbow of the curve' are slim. So there must be something that stacked the odds in favor of you being born now, ie this is the most people there will ever be.

Even with us blanketing all the streets in 5G routers, if you go behind a brick wall and lose it... well that sucks. If they can figure out how to fix that to increase the range and utility, 5G is great. Super fast speeds. With how technology is progressing, we need ever more speed and bandwidth to keep up with 4k-8k streaming/uploading, constant cloud back-ups and downloads, large patches and updates, etc. The good news is that 5G will pretty much always run with a backbone of 4GLTE.

I checked the manual of the instrument I was controlling. There was documentation for a digital interface. You had to code the instructions manually after establishing the connection, but it was possible. I found a cable to interface the local computer with the instruments I needed to control. I wrote a program that would connect to the instrument and send the required instructions at the click of a button. Then I used remote desktop functionality to access that computer from my laptop, while sitting in my office. And from then on all I had to do was go in the lab at the beginning of the day, turn the machines on, then turn them off at the end.

That's not quite right, so you might want to reread the original proposal. Bostrom's hypothesis is not that there are myriad intelligent civilizations, but rather that we are part of a civilization whose future includes a state of technological sophistication in which many ancestor simulations are built. &gt; how can we look at the universe in our level of reality that is a simulation, and infer anything about the higher reality? The natural response from an advocate of the simulation hypothesis would be: well, for example, through the kind of reasoning I've just given in defending the simulation hypothesis. There may be a problem with this sort of reasoning, but in that case what you ought to do is point out the problem, rather than just dismissing its possibility at face. &gt; Would not the proper argument be: there exists many intelligent civs in our universe - therefore there is likely a simulated lower level reality under ours?

I strongly - STRONGLY - urge people (particularly women and POC, who are statistically less likely to apply to a role unless they hit every bullet) to apply to jobs they are interested in but aren’t 100% qualified for. Hiring managers are generally not insane and look for people that are engaged, curious and open-minded. The worst case scenario is that you get more experience interviewing, and a potential connection for the future. The best case is that you literally get the job!",1132

What does the piggy do? Where is the tractor?) *The Very Hungry Caterpillar* by Eric Carle, which is the greatest kiddy book of all time, and then a lot by Oliver Jeffers and almost anything by David McKee. We borrowed loads of stuff from the library, even more than nowadays, and that gave us all sorts of things I'm not going to remember. When we got to chapter books at ages 5 and 7, we started with Roald Dahl (literally everything over a year or two) and *The Chronicles of Prydain* by Lloyd Alexander. Ages 7 and 9 saw *Harry Potter*, which they were probably a bit too young to fully appreciate, but which everyone else was already watching the films of. Also *A Series of Unfortunate Events* by Lemony Snicket and then his *All the Wrong Questions* series. Ages 9 and 11 were dominated by the *Un- Collection* (*Uncanny*, *Unreal*, *Unbelievable*, etc.) by Paul Jennings. Tehy were awesome. At the moment, ages 10 and 12, we are finishing off the *Miss Peregrine's Peculiar Children* series. It's certainly not my favourite, but the kids really got into it. Add to this numerous different novels about horses and princesses, Greek legends my wife tells them and stories she makes up for them, stories I've made up for them, as well as the ones we make up for them together and it's a lot of stories and reading.

The technology has also facilitated important cuts in fuel use and tillage changes, resulting in a significant reduction in the release of greenhouse gas emissions from the GM cropping area. **In 2018, this was equivalent to removing 15.27 million cars from the roads**.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21645698.2020.1773198) [Although GE crops have been previously implicated in increasing herbicide use, **herbicide increases were more rapid in non-GE crops**. Even as herbicide use increased, chronic toxicity associated with herbicide use decreased in two out of six crops, while acute toxicity decreased in four out of six crops. In the final year for which data were available (2014 or 2015), glyphosate accounted for 26% of maize, 43% of soybean and 45% of cotton herbicide applications. However, due to relatively low chronic toxicity, glyphosate contributed only 0.1, 0.3 and 3.5% of the chronic toxicity hazard in those crops, respectively.](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14865) [On average, **GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yields by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68%**.

Then I use color coded sticky tabs to track the scenes that forward the main plot, the b plot, and (if relevant) the ""past"". Next I break all those into scenes and make a list of all the scenes with the characters that appear in them, where they happen, and a sentence or two saying what the major event is in the scene (so: MC scene 4, batman and Alfred, Alfred gives Batman a device to bypass Bad Guy's shields) After all this, I start transcribing, scene by scene, what I've highlighted into my scriptwriting software. While I do this, I tinker with dialogue, trim some fat, clarify some things, and at the end I have a script that's WAY too big, but now I have something to revise, and I probably don't look at the book again, because my script has everything in it.

t3_nazw0n,ELI5: What do the songs we like do to our brain that makes us like them and why does it differ from person to person?,gxwr7q0,"Musical taste is generational, and cultural. To avoid deviating too much from eli5 territory, it has to do with sound waves. The sound waves have ups and downs, they look like mountains and valleys. A soundwave has a frequency, the word frequency by definition just means ""how often something repeats"" so the frequency of a soundwave tells us how ofteb the mountains and valleys repeat. If its a high frequency soundwave it means it has many short, but often repeating mountains and valleys. If its a low frequency it means it has longer, less often repeating mountains and valleys. In music, the word melody means ""sounds that are played after eachother"" and harmony means ""sounds that are played at the same time"" (like a chord) Generally the sounds that we find ""harmonius"" or consonant, are sounds where the frequencies of the sound waves align. This means that the two sounds being played together, has the top of their mountains meeting at a close point, and so its valleys. A soundwave with double the fequency will always align, even though one of them is higher. This just means that for every 1 mountain and vallet for the lower soundwave, there is 2 mountains and valleys for the higher. The octave is double the frequency, and is considered the most harmonious. But if you play frequencies where the mountains and valleys do not allign, it will often sound like the sounds clash. This is called dissonance, and its the reason why a miss-played note in a song sounds very out of place. However, dissonance is not always bad. Music generally works by building tension by using dissonance, and then resolving that tension with consonance. Songs are kind of like telling a story, you cant just have the good parts, there needs to be some tension as well! But its also very very cultural. Ive described music out of the western 12-tone equal temperament system but there are many many more systems in the world, with different notes. This is why middle-eastern music may sound out of tune for someone who is not raised there. But if you grow up with that kind of music it sounds very natural. Thats not to say it sounda bad for you if you are not raised in the middle east, but it explains why other cultures music systems may sound ""out of tune"". Its just because we have not been raised with that music.",2312

Of course, this isn't really a triangle in the 3D world, only in the 2D world of the sphere's surface. But if the 3D world is itself not ""flat,"" then the 3D shapes we know might look very different in 4D, if that's a thing.

I can say I've used multiple tools, watched multiple videos, and analyzed multiple stories and have taken little bits of knowledge from each one as I've gone. I do kind of like it that there hasn't been a single source I can say has influenced me more than others, though. It kind of builds your characteristics as an author.

t3_nc9fx7,Eli5:Why does an edible thing boil when put in water but fry when put in oil?,gy3s3p8,"You should realize that a boiling liquid has constant temperature. If you put a pot of cold water on a flame, the flame adds heat energy to the water, increasing its temperature. Until it reaches the boiling temperature of 100 Celsius 212 Fahrenheit. At that point, continued heat energy from the flame goes into ""breaking apart"" the water molecules from the rather closely packed liquid state, to the vapor (steam) state. The temperature of the liquid stays fixed at 100 Celsius while this is happening, despite the flame underneath continuing to add heat. So water serves the purpose of *limiting* the temperature of the ""edible thing"" (soup, etc.) so that it doesn't burn to a crisp. With the water gone, temperature shoots past 100 Celsius, and burn-to-a-crisp happens pretty fast. Oil has a much higher boiling temperature than water, but the things that we fry in oil usually have *some* water in them. There's still some temperature limiting, and you usually get the crisp (burn) on the outside, but soft on the inside (where the water ""protects"" from the higher temperature of the oil), like you see with fried foods (esp. french fries). Anyway, the temperature is limited while the liquid is boiling. The same thing happens with a solid melting (ice). Temperature of the whole lemonade is forced to stay at the melting temperature of water (0 Celsius, 32 Fahrenheit) while there's solid ice (still melting) in there. Despite how much heat the hot summer air outside your cup adds to the liquid.",1503

t3_nd3190,ELI5: What is the process of digitising old literature &amp; why are so many old books not?,gy9j4f6,"I have some relevant experience here. I've been involved with digitizing documents for a 100+ year old society and I also personally collect rare and antique books. To start, digitizing something isn't trivial. A lot of times, to get the best scan without bankrupting the organization, the books need to be torn so the page can lay flat on the scanner. Clearly not ideal but good for content that has a lot of duplicates where destroying a copy doesn't matter. For more unique items you cannot destroy, someone needs to actually handle each page and make sure the scan worked without issues (i.e. no blurring, etc). This very manual process means the cost is significantly higher not just in labor but you might need a specialized scanner. For more unique and older items, many of them are required to be in a library or some other organization where you likely won't be allowed to bring in your equipment so scanning it is simply not going to be done. Many libraries in particular might not have the resources to digitize the content. I'm not sure what you consider ""old"" since some of my books are 500 years old but anything older than about 200+ years old requires delicate handling. This means that you cannot use any regular scanner. There are slanted scanners that basically allow you open the book partially while it scans properly but like the previous example of manual scanning, this is even more expensive and more time consuming since the books are likely going to be more fragile. When you get into 500+ year old books, you also have a danger of exposing the contents to the bright light that's associated with the scanner. This could damage some books. In addition, some old books can get wavy with time so scanning them would not be ideal and would require additional work. The older the book, the more fragile it is, and the more work you need to digitize it. In a place like South Africa, they might not have the equipment or the funds (and likely both) to afford such an expense. It's a real tragedy when unique works are lost.",2045

For those who don't often partake, I'd recommend an infused cigar, maybe something from Drew Estate like their Acid line. I love them and smoke them pretty often even outside of fun events like a bachelor party. Those are tasty and not too overpowering when it comes to the overall flavor of the smoke. Talk to the guy at the shop. He'll be able to recommend sticks based on the meal you're planning to have or the post-dinner drinks that might pair well. They're reasonably affordable, around $6-7 per stick where I am, easy to smoke and are damn cool. At some point, you'll probably find yourself just sitting around enjoying some cocktails, anyway.

A turbojet engines do that but that is not what is used today, the airliners today are High-bypass turbofan engines. It use the exhaust to drive a turbine that dive the fan on the front of the engine. The majority of the trust is from the air the fan push around the engine. The engine bypass ratios is the amount of air around relative to trough the engines. Efficient engine today is at around 10x air around vs through the engine. So the fan work like a propeller with lost of blades. Modern propeller engines are turboprop engines so a turbine just like a jet engine that drive a propeller. So a electric aircraft can replace the the fuel burning and turbine part with a electric motor. So you connect the fan or propeller to a electrical engine. That is exactly how model aircraft has worked for decades.

t3_nj5prg,ELi5 - How do clothes get dry when hung outdoors in winter?,gz5m6cm,"Temperature is not what stops water from boiling, it is air pressure compared to vaporization pressure. The vaporization pressure depends on temperature. Water evaporates at lower temperatures than the boiling temperature, it can in fact evaporate at all temperatures it is a liquid. The name change so sublimation went is is solid but is still occur. The rate is temperature-dependent and if there is a net loss of water depending on the moisture level because water condensates too back to a liquid, so a net loss of water depends on the relative humidity of the air. A simple demonstration that is not temperature is to put room temperature water in a vacuum chamber and is start boiling with the pressure get low enough. The boiling requires energy and that results in the temperature of the remaining water dropping. The boiling will continue until the remaining water has frozen to ice. The Ice will sublimate, go from a solid directly to a gas but the rate is quite low. The energy requires for water to become a gas is almost identical at 100C as at 25C. It can be determined by measure the temperature drop of the water. It is this energy that water on our skin takes from our body that is the reason you can cool yourself down by sweating. The rate liquid water becomes a gas does depend on the temperature, at the same time water as a gas will condensate back to a liquid. Let's take a container that starts with a vacuum and fill half of it with water. It should be disconnected from the vacuum pump but it should have a pressure gauge. The result initial boiling but then you get an equilibrium where the evaporation rate is equal to the condensation rate. You now have liquid water on the bottom and water as a gas on top. You can measure the pressure of the gas and if you heat the water the pressure increase. When you 100C, 212 F the pressure will be 1 atmosphere, this is not a coincidence. At room temperature, the pressure is at 3% of an atmosphere. If you do not have an enclosed container the same process will occur water evaporates until the amount of water in the air is the same as in the container. If the air is not replaced with dryer air you have an equilibrium and the amount of liquid water remains constant. But air can move and if it is replaced with dry air the water will continue to evaporate until the liquid water is gone. So water will evaporate at all temperatures where it is liquid. When it becomes ice it will still become a gas but that is sublimation. The rate of evaporation, sublimation, and the amount of water that can be in the air is temperature-dependent. Let's look at boiling without a container. If you look at water that boils you see bubbles forming in the walls of the container and they rise to the surface and disappear. These are bubbles of water as a gas that are formed on nucleation sites, that is irregularities on the container or anything else where water can form bubbles. If water would start to form a bubble and the vapor pressure is less than the atmospheric pressure the result is that the will be compressed back down to a liquid. If the pressure of the gas is the same or higher than the atmosphere then the bubbles will support themselves and can grow, detach and rise to the surface where they can escape into the air. The gas that leaves the water will because of the pressure be able to push away the air. The result is that water can evaporate at a high rate in bubbles in the liquid as long as the temperature is high enough. This is what we call boiling. So it is not temperature directly that is required, it is vapor pressure versus atmospheric pressure. You can boil water in an enclosed container too. A pressure cooker is a pot with a lid and a valve that open as a set pressure. The result is that the boiling temperature of water increases. The pressure is generated by the gas the water release. The same way the boiling water at high altitudes occurs at a lower temperature because of the lower atmospheric pressure. So water will evaporate as long as it is liquid. If you lose liquid water will depend on the moisture level of the air. At 100% relative humidity you will not lose liquid water as long as the water is not boiling Boiling is not directly a question of energy or temperature but one of vapor pressure and atmospheric pressure. The vapor pressure does depend on the temperature. So there is a connection between temperature and boiling but it is not a question if enough molecules have enough energy. If that was the limiting factor water would not boil in a vacuum chamber at room temperature",4599

t3_nm4glg,what was the moment you realized you messed up a dating situation that was otherwise going good?,gzmfl2r,"When I was younger I knew a girl who was head over heels for me. Like, wait on the sidelines for the entirety of high school while I went through girlfriends and fuck buddies just waiting for me to give her a chance. We were great friends in my eyes, so I guess there was a hesitance there about changing that dynamic. We had a lot in common and she was probably my closest friend at the time, I told her everything. But she was gorgeous, there was definitely attraction, and I guess in a way maybe there was deep friendship being confused for romantic feelings in my teenage brain. And eventually we did start hooking up, and it did start getting messy. Mostly on my part, I have to admit. I guess that dynamic changing like that created a lot of... overwhelming feelings? And being young, I didn’t really know how to process any of that. I wouldn’t really acknowledge her affection. And I started getting distant, at one point I didn’t really talk to her for a week. Acted like a total jackass. And she had enough, told me so and that was that. I apologized probably a few months later, to no response (rightly so). I’ve thought about that “relationship” a lot since then. Not in a sad, “I miss her” kind of way (I’m in a very happy and healthy relationship now with an amazing person) but I think a lot about what she felt to have probably spent those years building up an image of me and what we could be like together, and the disappointment and sadness brought on by how I acted. I still feel bad about it. It changed a lot about how I treat people in general, but especially how I treat relationships. I’m a lot more careful about the actions I take and how they may affect the other person. I show affection a lot more, and show gratitude for receiving it. I don’t take my girlfriend for granted. Anyway, yeah. TLDR, don’t be a dick. Especially to people that care about you.",1883
t3_nm859x,If you could develop your dream video game what would it be?,gzmzqqo,"Some game with a really good soundtrack (despite me not being a muscian). I feel like a good game soundtrack has the potential to be very easy, and very influential to the game in question. I think if you want a solid story-heavy, deep, and grounded game, the cello is a good instrument for this type of music. Also, light piano is good for relaxing and beautiful vibes. Storywise, I would probably make it set in the present, maybe a game based around abstract messaging. Like, games like hollowknight (I haven't played it, but I wish I had the game). I wouldn't go too heavy of graphics, but I would try to make colors and scenes interesting. Maybe, colors tell the story, idunno. Gameplay is where the game-type I'm describing falls short almost. To a certain extent, you need to give up story elements for the sake of gameplay, so maybe I would make it a platformer, due to the fact that jumping on platforms doesn't have to change the dynamic of the game. I wouldn't want to focus on a mulitplayer with this said project in mind as a blueprint. It wouldn't work as such.",1075

Even though the flight was only an hour and a half long to our connecting flight, I was so angry I wanted to fight someone. Upon arriving to our connecting flight location, we found out our seating arrangements were going to be the same. We would have to sit many rows apart for a 7 hour flight. I asked the people who worked for the flight line if they could get us seats together, and they gave us seats that were in the same row, separated by the aisle.

t3_nniqyd,ELI5: How is electricity physically stored in batteries?,gzure3y,"Electricity isn't a physical object to be collected up in one place like water; electricity is a phenomena caused when an electric field is created through a circuit. What gets stored in a battery is actually potential energy. Think of it like one of those rubber band propeller planes; when you wind up the propellor you haven't collected any physical object together in the rubber band, but you have stored potential energy in it. So when you let go that energy comes out again. In most batteries that energy is stored in the form of a chemical reaction in two halves. One half of that reaction produces 'free' electrons, and the other uses up 'free' electrons; so when you connect up a complete circuit the electrons get pushed around from the side producing them to the side using them up again. In a regular cell this reaction is pretty much a one off; but in a rechargeable cell it can be reversed so the cell can be used over again.",939

Kurt Wagner doesn't use this tactic often except with robots, as it is unusually brutal considering his general disposition. As such, we haven't really seen the limits of this ability. There are also several occasions of him trying and failing to do this, usually resulting him being injured. Likely if he tried to do this against an extremely physically powerful foe, they would resist, and he would strain himself trying, either teleporting only himself or nothing at all. If we imagine teleporting as opening a door to somewhere else, walking through it, and closing the door, this tactic would be like slamming the door on someone's arm so hard that it got cut off.

t3_npcz1b,ELI5 How can you transcode media to higher bitrates when there is no new information to be included?,h04fwk3,"You can run the transcode job and set the bitrate very high no problem. You're right in that the image quality won't be any higher than the original input (without something modifying the video in between, but we will ignore that). However that doesn't mean the bitrate you request is impossible. The encoder doesn't know what the source is. It just gets a bunch of still images in a row and needs to encode them into a video file. It looks at them and does its best to preserve all the details it sees. Now some of those ""details"" will actually be the errors and artefacts of the lower bitrate decoded version, but dammit, it's going to preserve them as best it can! All the bits that are available to it will be used to make the new output look as close to the input it was given! For some types of video - like a cartoon with very little motion and a lot of stills - you might not reach your requested bitrate. The encoder does reserve the right to say ""I've done my best, higher bitrates won't help"". However that point can still be way higher than the original input. Also don't forget multiple codecs exist. I might convert from codec A to codec B. If codec B is worse than codec A, yeah it's going to need more bits just to not go to crap relative to what codec A can do. An original master source would be preferable to the codec A file I have, but sometimes you make do with what you have.",1398

Technically you could touch the neutral wire with one hand and for example a metal pipe in your house with the other and nothing would happen. If you do the same with the other (hot) wire, you'd get shocked. Light switches for example are supposed to switch the hot wire, not the neutral one, because otherwise a light fixture that's turned off at the switch would still potentially be dangerous to work on. The core idea here is that voltage is always relative. If you take an AA battery and you touch the negative terminal of it to a metal pipe in your house, then the positive terminal of the battery is now at +1.5V relative to the (earthed) pipe. But if you touch the pipe with the positive terminal instead, the negative terminal would be at -1.5V relative to the pipe and earth.",899

What if demographics like India are not considered where societal pressure is more?,gws3guz,"I think this really depends on what your expectations are for marriage in the first place. Arranged marriage works surprisingly well, from what I've seen, among peoples who take a very practical and unromantic view of marriage — it's a bilateral contract for helping maintain the community's population, no more no less. In a lot of these cultures, many people are perfectly OK with their spouse not being their most salient interpersonal relationship, and consider it a bonus if they *ever*, never mind deep into the relationship, find their spouse highly sexually attractive. No, the goal of a successful match in cultures with strong traditions of arranged marriage, is the matching of two successful business partners, who complement each other well in working together toward a common goal (raising children, caring for the elderly, and promoting communal cohesion).

t3_n62wba,How should we interpret human ability to imagine impossibilities and get stuck in unprovable claims?,gx4yuaa,"&gt; Human beings are so paranoid. Descarte's demon making fun of us while controlling laws of nature, solpsism, brains in the vat,just to name a few. We tend to have ability to get stuck in logic by coming up with unprovable and undisprovable theories. Why do we do that? In philosophy this is done to push the boundaries of epistemology and often helps to come up with better epistemic insights in trying to respond to them. I don't think many philosophers do get ""stuck"" with them. &gt; Even science seems to comply to this quality of human mind. Probability of even extremly rare events is almost never 0. And when someone puts a probability to 0, another person will come up with ""what if"" We can always imagine a sneaky way how something impossible can actually happen. We add zeroes after the coma but we feel urge to put this one on the end. Just in case. Why are humans capable of coming up with such a absurd things? I find it weird and unnerving. Like everything's possible. And I don't mean it in a good way. I don't see anything absurd going on here. There are usually some unaccounted variables which can result in a degree of randomness (or pseudo-randomness) which leaves an ever-so-slight chance open that the experimental findings are erroneous. This isn't explicitly related to paranoia about being a brain in a vat or being under the influence of Descartes' Demon. &gt; Every clean cut answer about nature of reality crashes on it. Theism, atheism. Theism even more , since the mere possibility of bolzmann brains just don't very well fit into neat concept of world ruled by omnibenevolent, omnipotent, omniscient being. Why would god make us come up with those terrifying statistical aberrations? This seems like a variation of the problem of evil. Theists can just answer ""it is a necessary evil"" for a greater good. To have sufficient intelligence (which is a good) in a finite context is to necessarily have the capacity to imagine wierd possibilities. Moreover, normally people are not that bothered by remote possibilities. So most people wouldn't even call it as an important kind of ""evil"". Your terror seems idiosyncratic (although you aren't necessarily alone). There can be a more secular answer based on evolution but I won't go there. But more generally it would seem that ability to imagine wierd possibilities would be a byproduct of ability of imagining possibilities and counterfactuals in general (see [this](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/modality-epistemology/) for an article concerning epistemology of modality) &gt; And eastern religions and philosopies? The same problem. Why would in a world made of pure love and oneness exist those types of concepts? You may be significantly misunderstanding some of those Eastern religions. &gt; If you know some literature on that topic don't hesitate to recommend it May be these will help: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/modality-epistemology/ https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/ https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/1sk.htm https://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/files/wittgenstein-on-certainty.pdf",3102

Once I said this, he stopped moving and I was able to see a grey face underneath the blankets. This scared me a bit and I decided to face the other side of the bed.

t3_n7b67s,Do contemporary formalists criticize the merits of Godel's incompleteness theorem? What is the relation of enmity that might exist between the two?,gxekijg,"Both of your questions sound weirdly phrased to me. Gödel's incompleteness theorems aren't up for dispute, they are mathematical theorems. They're neither criticized or something that has a relation of enmity to something, it doesn't engage in any dispute where we figure out if formalism is true or the incompleteness theorem. Do you simply want to know why the incompleteness theorems essentially canceled the formalist programs of Hilbert and Co? Well, the second theorem says that exactly the thing formalists wanted to do was impossible. Hilbert wanted to show that we don't need some 'deeper' commitment to a system of infinitary mathematics like ZFC, but that it can be understood as a formal system that we can prove consistent with the means of finitary mathematics. Finitary mathematics was seen as more secure because its consistency never really was in question. It's very easy to believe that peano arithmetic is consistent, you can look at the natural numbers and see that there is a structure in which all axioms are true at the same time, so they're not inconsistent. And once we proved that ZFC is consistent using those secure tools, we don't really need to worry about anything. But Gödel's second theorem says that the consistency of a system like ZFC can't be proven from a weaker system. So this entire project can't be successful.",1353

Fast forward when I was in college, I took German and on the last day of my first quarter our teacher gave us a lesson on German swear words. I come to find out that 'scheiße"" is shit in German. So every time she would need to say ""shit"" my mom just used a german curse word. When i had this revelation my whole childhood perspective changed. I called my mom to ask her if she knew, thinking that she may unsuspectingly be cursing in a language she didnt know. Turns out a old colleague of hers who spoke German taught her the word a long time ago and she used it so she could curse without ""tainting"" us.

t3_n9ukp0,ELI5: What is tranexamic acid’s mechanism of action for controlling bleeding?,gxpty8k,The lab I work for this is our speciality. The ELI5 answer: TXA keeps blood clot proteins from breaking down. A slightly more technical answer is: TXA prevents the formation of the protein plasmin from plasminogen. TXA is chemically similar to the amino acid lysine and binds to lysine receptors on plasminogen. Plasmin degrades the protein fibrin. Fibrin together with platelets forms blood clots. So TXA increases the levels of fibrin leading to clotting. TXA isn't a direct thrombotic. It's a reversible inhibitor of the protein that degrades fibrin. I'm happy to go in to more details but I'm trying to keep it ELI5.,620

t3_n9uxmq,Eli5: why do kids hate vegetables?,gxpvkpo,"You have part of it. But the question has many multifaceted answers, developing taste buds are a part of the puzzle. From a behavioural point of view, you can think of it as a display of power. Kids crave power and control, which sounds bad because our immediate thoughts are of adults that crave power and control. But remember kids are born completely dependant, and as they develop they naturally want to have some sort of influence on their environment. One of these things is what they eat. Because parents can't force you to eat, which is why it's common for kids as they get a little older to become picky eaters, they've realised that this is an outlet where they can have more control. It's one of the first things which them saying 'no' tends to have an impact. Vegetables tend to be a villain because they're healthy and parents want their kids to eat them. They get pushed more, and that pushiness makes kids want to flex what little autonomy they have. Then it becomes a game of stubbornness. They may very well like the food but they'll still 'not like it' because they want to be right. This can turn parents into forcing their child to eat vegtables against their wishes creating bad associations with the food. Again this is just another piece to the puzzle. They're a lot of factors at play here.",1314

But the expansion of space is very small, so it take light year of space to really see the effect. At small scale the local force that keep the solar system or our body together are far stronger. This is why near galaxy like Andromeda will collide with the milka way in the future. The gravity between the two is stronger than the expansion of space.

Codependency plays a big role in staying with the wrong person or in a toxic relationship. Actin like that really only hurts yourself and stresses you out. Why stress over something that hasnt happened yet? doesnt make sense. Pay attention to yourself when you feel like that. Ive caught myself being mad at someone for something that hasnt even happened.

t3_ncj64i,"With my current level of experience, what is the best avenue of entry into the book industry as an editor?",gy6cksr,"A lot of jobs in publishing go to people who have certificates from colleges in publishing programs. It's a really, really tough industry to crack in any meaningful way. My editors (all with bigger publishers) toiled a long time in poorly, or unpaid, internship positions for years before slowly climbing up. There are just vastly more qualified applicants than there are positions, and those positions themselves always seem to be shrinking. As such, 'pivoting' from an outside industry into publishing, at least on the editorial side, is not going to be easy, since there are people who have been trying to crack it directly for a very long time - probably longer than you (and while you've been in a different industry). I don't mean to dissuade you. People say the same thing about writers who make a living publishing books, and yet - people do it all the time! Just because it's tough, doesn't mean you can't do it!

t3_nct7kf,eli5 how is it possible to program a computer to “understand a keyboard” without a keyboard?,gy6z3tu,"The thing that makes a computer understand a keyboard is just another piece of software. You can create that bit on a computer that does have a keyboard and then make it part of the OS (or even BIOS) that will be installed on the computer that doesn't have one. Your computer was built to understand keyboards before you even got it. If you're asking about the *first* keyboard: there was always some way of providing input to a computer. In the earlier days you had punchcards. They build the computer so that it could read the holes in the card, and you can 'write' the software that can communicate with a keyboard via those cards.",634

Bride to be called it off after the bachelorette party because she found out the groom hooked up with the maid of honor a few times before the bride met the groom. Thing was the bride didn't care that the groom and maid of honor had hooked up in the past. What the bride cared about was that the maid of honor was married while she was hooking up with the groom and the groom knew and just didn't care. Bride figured if the groom could so easily violate the bonds of one marriage then it was clearly no big deal or anything to be taken seriously to the groom and the bride was convinced that the groom was therefore likely to treat his own marriage with the same amount of disrespect. So she decided to spare herself the heartache and obvious cost of a potential divorce. Was probably the right decision as the now ex-groom was heart-broken just long enough to crawl into the still married former maid of honor's bed and let her ""sooth his aching heart"".

I matched with someone with a lot of the same interest, anime, gaming etc. She looked amazing and was down as 24. So we chatted and organised a date We meet up, go for a walk and play pokemon go. Her idea so I just went with it. We had a lovely 4 hour walk along the beach. During the last hour she changes the conversation and starts talking about a few key things; 1) Shes a fresher (I've still not realised she looks a little young for 24) and she quite fancied another fresher in her flat. Apparently she told him how she felt within 2 days and he laughed at her saying hes out of her league. So she came to tinder. 2) She'd only had one sexual relationship. Her former boss. Who was also married and had two kids. 3) She then revealed she was 18, turning 19 in 6 months. She sets her tinder bio to a higher age because she prefers older guys based on her (creepy) experience. So we finish the date there and she asks about a 2nd date. Now normally I'd say no in a heart beat because of the actual age gap. But given her preferences, I said we could try one more to see how it goes. I get back to my flat and a few hours later get a text from her cancelling the next date. She went back and told this fresher how much of a wonderful date she had and she was having another. At which point he said ""well I only told you that stuff because I panicked and really like you"", so she decided to ""try with him"". I wished her the best of luck and blocked that number.",1514

They don't just form, they are created by something pushing the water (usually wind). So when a ship goes through water, it pushes the waves to the side (due to the shape of the hull being designed to cut through the water) or just flattens the water, leaving a calmer patch behind it. Unless there is really strong wind, once a ship has travelled over a section of water, it'll remain flat until either wind creates new waves or waves from outside the calm zone move into it, which usually takes a while as the wake from the ship (the turbulent water) acts as a barrier.",638

Depending on whether the hemoglobin is bound or not, it changes the way light is absorbed, and the device can use this data to give you a number. There are definitely some limitations. For example, technically the device is only seeing if your hemoglobin is bound to something (and assumes it's oxygen). If you have carbon monoxide poisoning, the CO will bind tightly to your hemoglobin, and the device will actually read 100%, even if it's way lower in reality. Or if you have really bad anemia (low hemoglobin), the device may not be able to accurately give a number and may give a lower number than reality. Your anemia would have to be really significant before this becomes an issue.",824

They came in minutes after we did. It's only my birthday friend Kayla, and our other 3 friends. So we are ordering our food, and we ask for drinks. The family that came in, was to the right of us. I kept looking over at the family out of curiousity because the kids kept yelling and I was annoyed, so I spent most the time there just tryna ignore them. An hour goes by, we are eating and 15-20 minutes into eating, the youngest kid (im assuming) just throws a whole tantrum. Screaming, yelling, whining, Every damn thing. Until he pulled down his shorts and just let it rip. It was green and orange. The way it all just blended in together scared and disgusted everyone that saw it. The mom was panicking, asking for service, the dad was in the bathroom I think, so he didn't see it. The poop SMELLED. So i'm also eating this delicious pasta there and just witnessing all that, I started gagging hard af.

t3_nghzkn,ELI5: how are hot-air balloons navigated?,gyr1pqx,You need a good knowledge of meteorology so you can make observations and predict the way the winds travel at different altitudes. A lot of times wind might go around mountains and other terrain features or you might have different air layers with different winds so the air can move in different directions at different altitudes. An experienced balloon pilot will be able to predict these different winds or just experiment though them and find the right altitude where the winds take him where he needs to go. But if you are under the impression that a hot air balloon can travel in any direction the pilot wants you are mistaken. The level of control is enough to land it safely but in order to get where you are going you need to pay attention to the weather forecast beforehand and pick a take off spot carefully so that the wind actually take you there. But this is perfectly fine for sight seeing tours and such.,920

t3_nh55y8,What types of (modern formal) Logic are there?,gyux8dv,"A very complex question. Many of the distinctions that you asked about cut across each other---logic, it turns out, is complicated! The following is liable to be a bit confusing if you're just getting into the terminology, so feel free to follow up on anything that you don't get. **Propositional vs predicate** This is probably the oldest distinction. Roughly, propositional logic deals with full sentences. So, for instance, the following is valid argument in propositional logic: &gt; A &gt; A --&gt; B ------ &gt; B where A and B are both sentences like ""the moon is made of green cheese."" Predicate logic, by contrast, deals with objects and the properties of the them. So, for example, this is a valid argument in predicate logic: &gt; ∃xFx &gt; ∀y(Fy --&gt; Gy) ----- &gt; ∃xGx In English, those sentences say ""there is (∃) some x that has property F""; ""all objects (∀) that have property F have property G""; and ""therefore, there is some x that has property G."" In an average intro logic class, you'll usually start with propositional logic and then move onto ""first-order"" predicate logic. **First- vs higher-order logic** So what does first-order logic mean? Earlier, I used these symbols called ""quantifiers"" (∃x and ∀x) to represent ""some object"" and ""all objects."" You could also introduce quantifiers to talk about the properties too. So, you could develop a logic with quantifiers that worked like this: &gt; ∃F(Fa) &gt; ∀G(Ga --&gt; Gb) ----- &gt; ∃F(Fb) In English, those sentences say ""there is (∃) some property F such that a has the property F""; ""b has all properties (∀) that a has""; and ""therefore, there is some property F such that a has the property F."" A logic is called ""first-order"" if it only has quantifiers for objects, and ""second-order"" if it has quantifiers for the properties. It turns out that first-order logic has a lot of nice properties---""classical"" versions of first-order logic are mathematically simple in some very nice ways. In particular: everything that is true according to the axioms of logic is also provable by the logic, and vice-versa. And it turns out that the same thing isn't true for second-order logic, which makes it much harder to work with. In an intro class, you almost certainly won't study second-order logic; frankly, I've never really studied it, and I've taken something like half a dozen logic courses. **Classical vs. non-classical** Alright, so I mentioned classical and non-classical logics there, and said that the classical logics are simple. What's this distinction? I think it's fair to think of classical logic as the ""basic"" or ""standard"" logic. But it has some principles that people find perplexing. So, for example, the following is valid in classical logic: &gt; A ----- &gt; ~A --&gt; B Where ""~A"" means ""not A."" That seems weird! That means that the sentence ""if the moon is not made of green cheese, then I can fly"" is true according to classical logic. Similarly, it allows for double negation elimination: &gt; ~~A ------ &gt; A Some people think that two negations shouldn't always cancel each other out. The logics that people develop with different rules than these are called ""non-classical"" logics. The most famous of them are intuitionistic logic (changes the second rule), relevance logic (changes the first), and paraconsistent logic (changes a whole bunch of things). You almost certainly won't talk about these much in an intro course, but some of them are pretty cool and wacky. **Other types of logic** Finally, there are various types of logic that can be thought to differ in their subject area. So the basic logics discussed above really only deal with truth and falsity. You can add other topics, though, such as &gt; possibility and necessity (modal logic) &gt; future and past (temporal logic) &gt; permissibility and obligation (deontic logic) these are probably the three main ones, and they get very complex very fast. One reason why is that there are propositional, first-order predicate, second-order predicate, classical, and non-classical versions of modal logic *plus* a whole bunch of different versions of modal logic---as I said, the different categories cut across each other! You probably won't deal with these either in an intro class---but there are often dedicated classes on modal logic, because philosophers think it's really interesting. **Which of these are used in philosophy?** All of them, and probably more. But the main ones are classical propositional logic, first-order predicate logic, and a modal logic known as ""S5"" (roughly, the idea behind this modal logic is that everything that is possibly possible is possible---but you don't have to have that rule!). Others come up in much more specialized domains.",4741

If the first author is a woman the paper is less likely to be cited. If the journal is famous, more highly cited. If the topic is controversial lots of citations but many will be disagreeing with the paper's findings.

So I stayed there for probably 20 to 30 minutes, trying to keep this super drunk woman calm. She had knocked her front teeth out, and there was lots of blood from her mouth, and from the glass in her face. She was also wearing a whole bunch of some kind of perfume.

t3_njsgax,If you needed to sing in your music class but dont want too because its embarassing whats the best way to get out of doing it?,gz92pan,"Man, I'm a professional musician and I have nothing but sympathy. I know exactly the scenario. But tell exactly what you just wrote to your teacher before or after class, he or she should at least be sympathetic. However, I don't think you should try to ""get out of it"" entirely. You need to at least try singing with your teacher when no one else is around. A decent teacher should try to help you overcome your [~~goal~~] vocal anxiety, but it can be tough. But a lot of the teacher's work requires group singing, so he or she may try to encourage you to sing with others. As a music teacher, we get it, especially middle school students when their voices are changing. Boys voices crack completely uncontrollably, and some students have a full range of about four notes. I know, I was an adolescent boy once myself. And moody teenagers can get so bitter, jaded, and hateful about having to sing. That's obviously not what we're trying to cultivate in our students, but it can be hard to avoid. Some kids kinda just ""go for it"" knowing it'll get laughs, this liberates them but they typically get stuck in that joke and it's hard to get them to progress. I think of my own singing voice as pretty ugly-sounding, but I was able to overcome my vocal anxiety anyway. If I have any advice, I might suggest trying to look at it from the teacher's perspective. Music teachers have a really challenging task when people are at all different levels, and they have to deal with a tremendous burden of bad attitudes sometimes. At the very least, don't try to make the teacher's job *harder* than it already is.",1602

He didn’t have any furniture so we slept on the floor for three weeks. We were pour, young, and didn’t know any better. At the time, the Burger King across the street had 99 cent whoppers. We ate whoppers three times a day and spent the days at the beach. My brother and his fiancé had a romantic notion of living on the beach. After a year of hating Florida, barely finding work, and missing family, they came home to the Midwest and have been happy ever since.

t3_nkw5mw,ELI5: Why do different gear ratios give different torque? Why isn't it the faster a wheel goes the more torque it has?,gzf4t27,"The physical setup should be self-explanatory. If one gear has 24 teeth and another gear has 12 teeth (of the same size), the turning the 24-gear once will turn the 12-gear twice, just because of the size difference. Now, think about the energy you use to turn the gears, or work. The work you put in, minus the losses to friction, will be equal to the work that comes out; this is the conservation of energy. Work is also equal to the integral of force over distance; more simplified, work is equal to force multiplied by the distance this force is applied. So if you are putting work into turning the 24-gear and the 12-gear is turning twice as fast, the work has to balance out. In order for the work to balance out, the force exerted by the 12-gear must be half of the force you're exerting on the 24-gear. F/2 x 2D = F x D. And the same is true the other way. Each turn of the 12-gear moves the 24-gear half as far, so it must exert a force twice as large in order for the work to balance. 2F x D/2 = F x D. Torque is just rotational force. So the gear that spins faster must produce more torque, and the gear that spins slower must product more torque.",1158
t3_nkz3j9,What makes my writing cringe?,gzfpa2p,"Just on my very very first impressions (the doc you linked is 98 pages, after all), your writing is completely fine. Trust me when I say we've all seen, and honestly written, stuff which is vastly worse. I will say though that it does feel a bit *writerly*, and that's not necessarily a good thing. I sort of got the feeling that you were trying really hard to inject spice into the opening through the writing itself to make up for the fact that, on the surface, it's just a few mundane kids walking home from school. &gt;“Is this it?” That shadowy voice echoed through his skull once again. That sickening silky voice with those three damn words. This, for example, is just a little much. At least not in context. It's a weird break from the otherwise very solid, but decidedly matter-of-fact prose in the rest of the scene.It's a bit like if Eminem broke into operatic singing mid-verse. Opera isn't *bad*, but its place isn't in the middle of an Eminem verse (unless it's sampled, of course, but then it's not him doing the singing). The only real advice I could give is, I suppose, to just relax. You don't need to justify your writing by trying to sound like ""a writer"". Your voice is perfectly fine. If you feel the urge to add a flourish to a certain description, maybe take a moment and ponder why you feel the need. Also there's a bit to be said about overuse of the ""dangling participle"". I'm not a big fan of that particular term; it strictly refers to the error, but it's more well known than ""absolute phrase"".These are sentences such as: &gt;His backpack bit into his shoulders, *his lower back aching dimly.* &gt; &gt;*Focusing on Matt’s voice,* Aaron could piece together the long disorganized rambling\[...\] &gt; &gt;*Realizing that conversation was going nowhere for him*, he let Matt’s voice fade into garbled background noise.

Every major Hegel scholar today rejects that this idea exists in Hegel. Scholars in the 1800s did not think so either, and Proudhon's conception was widely considered to be a misreading. Virtually every book of secondary literature I've ever read on Hegel makes great pains to explain and 'debunk' the popular misconception that 'thesis-antithesis-synthesis' is part of Hegel's thought. The postgrad university courses I took on Hegel also took great pains to point this out ('Here's what many people think Hegel meant vs what he actually meant', etc). In other words, it is a popular myth and it is well-known as one. In regard to Marx: no, Marx did not use these terms and did not read Hegel that way.",840

t3_nloo49,ELI5: Why do some flies just circle around the middle of a room all the time?,gzjrzgu,"2 possible reasons I see - first, flies often fly in circles near food sources in an attempt to get a mate to notice them. Second, it may essentially be a bug (pardon the pun) in their software. Insect nervous systems are very simple and they're often more easily understood as complex biological robots than as having cognitive thoughts like other animals. Keep in mind that ""rooms"", that is to say four walls and a ceiling, arent natural environments that flies are used to dealing with. The circling then could be due either to the neural circuits that keep the fly from running into obstacles getting stuck in a loop since there's always a nearby obstacle (a wall), or, since many insects navigate by keeping a fixed position relative to the sun or moon, it could be confused either by the light in the room or by the lack of a light as strong as the sun.",859

Counseling helped me become more comfortable with being myself, and I am now a medical provider. Because of my experience I am now a huge supporter of counseling no matter how big or small your worries may seem. They would never make you quit the things you love. Especially if those activities are getting you out and being social. Counseling is about being your best self, not changing who you are. I would like to mention though that sometimes it might take a few tries to find a counselor that you really find works for you. After a few weeks if you don't feel comfortable being open and honest, it's totally okay to try someone else!

[He can be a (very) controversial figure among academics, and he has had his fair share of strong disagreements.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Gladwell#Reception) Broadly speaking, I have enjoyed his books and there are for example articles he has written for the *New Yorker* I believe are insightful, however I would invite approaching his production with due diligence: i.e. *reader beware* and do not use him as a primary source for scientific knowledge. I mostly share [Andrew Gelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Gelman)'s opinion, who has written multiple times on his blog about Gladwell and his controversies or debates with other academics. [Quote](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/09/12/valley-of-gladwell/): &gt;**Gladwell is a fun writer, and I like how he plays with ideas.** To my taste, though, **he lives in an uncanny valley between nonfiction and fiction, or maybe I should say between science and storytelling.** I’d enjoy him more, and feel better about his influence, if he’d take the David Sedaris route and go all the way toward storytelling (with the clear understanding that he’s telling us things because they sound good or they make a good story, not because they’re true), or conversely become a real science writer and evaluate science and data claims critically. Instead **he’s kind of in between, bouncing back and forth between stories and science, and that makes uncomfortable.** In short, he has reported on or publicized good research and promoted engagement among laypeople with the social sciences, **however** it is also true that there are problems with the scientific accuracy of his books, and the quality of his fact checking. [See here for some extended discussion on the topic, again by Gelman.](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2013/10/11/gladwell-vs-chabris-david-vs-goliath/) I would recommend taking his books for what they are (emphasis on *entertainment* rather than education), and as a gateway into the world of the social sciences, keeping in mind that his work is not academic, and that [his primary goal is to be a populariser](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/01/malcolm-gladwell-interview-talking-to-strangers-apolitical), i.e.: “to get people to take human psychology seriously and to respect the complexity of human behaviour and motivations”.",2483

(I said most, because we're thinking about the biggest probability here. We're not considering the other classes or jobs that happen either during nigh-shift or outside of the aforementioned hours). If most jobs and or classes start at between 7 and 10 AM, this means, that person would usually wake up at between 6 - 9 AM (considering they take a minimum of 1 hour to get there, about the average commuting time, which is my guess only). So we need an exception, that happened before 6 Am, which made that person tired. If they would wake up at 5:30 AM, that would be early-er, but not sufficiently early to make them feel tired, if they would normally wake up at 6AM. But it would be sufficiently early to make them feel tired, if they would normally wake up at 7,8 or 9 AM. If they usually wake up at 6 AM, earlier most likely means 5 AM. Based on the above, my guess is that, depending on their job / school schedule, this person woke up somewhere between 5 AM and 6:30 AM.",1404

t3_n6bvfm,Why do most philosophers disagree with moral relativism?,gx6mpvt,"&gt; It is an empirical fact that what is considered good or bad, right or wrong is relative, contingent on contexts whether they are cultural, social, temporal or situational etc. When we say this, though, we should be careful about what we cash out as being relative to what. For instance, as per your example, are there many cultures (as a matter of empirical fact) believe that the best actions (morally speaking) are the ones which cause the most suffering? Are there many cultures which believe that right actions are the ones which are done for reasons which contain logical contradictions? Are there many cultures which believe that cowardice, dishonesty, and vanity are admirable traits? That is, when we talk about this relativity, are we talking about the apparent diversity of how specific material practices are evaluated or are we talking about the diversity of the evaluative criteria?",900

Yes, I put some thought into rather mundane, abstract things. Still kind of stuck on the plaid spray paint can though...

t3_n8kls0,ELI5 why are carton containers for liquids square when their plastic and tin counterparts are cylindrical?,gxixsf7,"Something to consider here is the folding of the package. Start with a flat square sheet of paper, roll a tube, then try and create a nice flat fold on one end, a cylinder with an open top and closed bottom, see how messy the folds are and how difficult it is to make it stand one its own. You cannot fold a cylinder to have a flat top and bottom plus design an easy pour mechanism with one sheet without creating weak points during the folds. The piece would crimp and pinch, these are stress points that could tear and spill your product. It is similar to but not exactly the same as the [Hairy Tennis Ball Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4UGZEjG02s). With the same flat square sheet you can make nice simple folds to create a square tube, which you can then easily fold into a close at one end. This squared shape is also fairly rigid, the stacking of the product is efficient with no space gaps, and it is easy design equipment to perform this task.

I'll take a stab at lowering that to 5 'grounding' is basically needed to ensure that everything is at the same 'electrical level' (voltage).The hazard of not grounding something is that if the electrical level (voltage) is different in one place compared to another and you touch both, it becomes level by going through you (not good). So as long as everything you touch is all the same level it won't go through you because there is nowhere for it to go. As long as everything in the ISS is all connected to the frame so that it is all the same level (voltage) you are safe. This is why if a utility truck touches a power line and a worker gets out and touches the truck (high level/voltage) and the ground (low level/voltage) at the same time the electricity goes through their body and shocks them badly. If their co-worker JUMPS onto the ground and is never the bridge between the two levels (voltages) at the same time, they will be safe.

The area in which that happens is urban - Kaz is in the middle of a street next to an alleyway. In the time in which Kirigan is blinded by the flash, Kaz could have stepped in at least three different directions and maybe four - too many possibilities for Kirigan to easily follow up on: ""You two go either way up the alley, you, into that building, and I'll go further down the block"" seems... inefficient, when time is of the essence here. Basically, all Kaz needed to do was present Kirigan with a game theory multiple-choice problem and he became less of a target - not because of where he was hiding, but the mere fact of being hidden. Not worth the hassle of playing a shell game. One of the things I've enjoyed about the series is the way it shows (but doesn't tell) that Kaz is actually a better tactician than the general.",968

This is shady AF and, if this is what's going on, you should have it corrected. * A technical glitch. On the content management platforms I'm most familiar with, it's hard to imagine how an article would accidentally get credited to an additional author... But there are a lot of different technologies out there they could be using, and it's certainly not inconceivable that this could somehow happen in the course of migrating between different platforms, or even just due to a mistaken click when trying to do something else. * Since the original publication, the article was updated without consulting you, and the person who wrote the update(s) is getting legitimately credited for their contribution. Given you said this was an article about technology, and technology changes fast and articles about it often need updates to stay current, this seems like a pretty likely scenario... But would usually be pretty obvious. When I've seen this done, there's usually a note at the top or bottom of the article noting when it was last updated. TLDR: No, this isn't normal.

This is my kids favorite story about me getting in trouble in school. First off let me say I can be loud. Like I tried out for the world record loud and only fell short by a mere 3db loud. Sometimes I get carried away and will let loose with an unintentional, ear-shattering blast of sound. So way back in high school I was in Home Ec class. We were in the kitchen off the smaller gym that doubled as the lunchroom and study hall. Now it was fairly loud in the gym outside. In the kitchen my and my friends were, for whatever dumb class clown reason, making farm animal noises. We were supposed to be cooking but you know how it goes when the teacher leaves you unsupervised for 3 seconds. Anyway, we're making farm noises. Not very quietly. When I decide it would be funny to make a really loud goat noise. Right as I let loose with a mighty full blown BAA-AAAA-AAAAAA, the gym quiets down AND the home ec teacher walks in. This mighty BAA-AAAA-AAAAAA just BOUNCED off the walls and echoed. Every head in the gym turned towards the kitchen. The doors at both ends of the gym opened and teachers stuck their head in. I was like ""Yep. I'm a goat y'all"" and meekly went back to cooking my food. Felt like a total idiot. XD",1242

t3_ngve16,Would Thanos have won if Loki didn't take the Tesseract?,gyugbo9,"Let's think about it. Thanos doesn't attack the Asgardian refugee ship, and instead pokes around in the ruins of Asgard itself until he finds the Tesseract. Thor was going somewhere with his people... probably Earth? Let's assume he was headed for Norway before Thanos attacked. Let's also assume that the Tesseract is the last thing on his mind at the moment, but he'll think about it six months from now or something and figure he should probably check on it. He tells Thanos that it's destroyed along with Asgard, so maybe he wouldn't bother. But at least for now, Thor and Friends head back to Earth. Thanos digs around until he finds the Space Stone. Then he sends his minions to Earth. They grab Dr Strange with zero warning. However things on that end won't play out too differently. Peter Parker is still going to see a giant space ship and go to investigate. Instead of getting some warning and knowing Thanos is coming, Tony Stark will likewise see a giant alien space ship and will choose to investigate. Bruce's warning to everyone basically gave them about half an hour to think about what was happening and come to terms with it. So Tony, Peter, and Dr Strange will all end up on Ebony Maw's ship together, just as they did originally. Bruce will probably be hanging out in Norway with Thor, so he's not calling Steve Rogers. Potentially Wong could do that, but we don't know if he'd think about it. Thanos' minions will attack Scarlet Witch and Vision as normal. I think Cap and his crew were still relatively close by when that attack happened. Quinjets fly fast, but not cross the world in minutes fast. I think it would have been faster for them to call Wanda on the phone and say ""hey we think bad guys are looking for Vision"" than to fly there. So they were probably close by anyway. A giant ship over Edinburgh attracts attention. so I don't think the warning call they got from Bruce necessarily changed events there. Cap and friends drive away Thanos' minions, as they did originally. Thanos gets the Reality Stone from the Collector as normal. He still needs to meet Gamora and uncover the location of the Soul Stone though. Now that I think about it, I think he knew the GotG were close by, and he knew Thor would probably survive to tell them about him. Thanos was expecting them at Knowhere, which is why the illusion with the Collector was already in place when they arrived. It's a simple change in plans to go meet the Guardians somewhere else. I think mostly everything is going to play out as it did in the actual film. And now that I've thought it through fully, it doesn't really matter. Thanos still ""wins"", and the only thing that is important is that Tony remains alive to invent time travel. Assuming the snap goes the same way it did originally, as long as Tony and Ant-Man are still alive, that's all you *really* need.",2859

t3_nh3b66,ELI5: How do bots work?,gyu26b2,"Reddit has an API (Application Programming Interface) which is basically just a web page meant for software to read and interact with, rather than a human. In Reddit's case, it's a series of pages where a program can read comments or other information, then post their own comments, without having to deal with the fluff of the visual aspects. In the Shakespeare bot's case, it's basically asking Reddit every few seconds for ""all the posts in a specific set of subreddits,"" which reddit gives it. The program, which is running on its creator's computer, then does some processing to figure out which comments it wants to reply to and what it will say, and then uses the same API to reply directly to the original comment. However, in order to do this, the bot itself needs its own account, with its own credentials (username &amp; password). The bot sends this information along with the contents of its post so that Reddit knows what username to associate with the bot. This also gives Reddit the power to ban a bot as if it were a human, because to Reddit's servers, they're basically the same thing.",1103

t3_nhtrfl,What financial information/advice do you wish you knew before entering academia?,gyz8805,"This goes without saying, but do everything you can to stay out of debt. I'm namely talking about credit card debt. I couldn't really manage everything on my grad student salary, and slowly racked up a a hunk of credit card debt (~$16,000 over a few years, which also included some medical bills, I swear I wasn't being totally irresponsible). Sometime before I graduated I built my self a credit card calculator to figure out how/if/when I could ever pay this off. I realized I could pay it, with diligence, after I had a better salary. But, I didn't realize: A) That it's almost a miracle I landed a job with a decent salary in the first place. B) That I'd be really behind on saving for other important things like buying a house because much of my money is going to paying off debts. C) That once I finally took a long hard look at my retirement funds, that I'd have to pay in much more than most people to catch up-- despite actually paying something toward retirement the whole time, which many grad students don't even do. D) Just how much my monthly student loan bill would be ($970 a month, after re-financing) I'll get there, but it's going to take a while. Also-- Pay into your retirement account, even if it's only a little bit each month. As a Postdoc, I definitely wasn't able to buy a house, but never felt like that made sense anyway. A post-doc is a temporary position. Houses are only good investments if you can stay for several years. My partner and I only began to consider where and when to actually buy a house when I accepted my TT job. If you are a PhD student just starting out with the means to do so and in an area with a decent cost of living, that would be a decent time to buy a small house because you are likely to be in the same area for several years. I do know a few people who have done that and it worked well for them, but I feel like that's a really special circumstance and I suspect they had some family money. The best advice for grad students is probably to: ~Have roommates to split expenses ~Have a strict (and feasible) budget, that includes a savings, and stick to it. ~Watch how much money you spend on beers and going out. ~If you have student loans from undergrad, pay at least something against them while you are in school, even if you are not required to by the terms of y our loans.",2338

The giant snake thing? There are invasive species (e.g., pythons) in the everglades and they have a profound and significant impact on ecosystems and stuff.

Facebook is another good place. I've found pages of groups that meet up to go hiking, go running, play volleyball, or do theatre cold reads. Some cities even have a page about the city where people can look for recommendations or places to eat or where to get a good haircut. Try posting a bit about yourself and your interests and say you're new in town and would like to meet some new friends. I've met people at the gym (I went at the same time every day, and always ran into the same girl, eventually we became friends) , or joining a class like yoga, jiu jitsu, boxing, spin class. Or maybe your interests lie more in things like culinary classes, woodworking, language learning, photography, or painting workshops. Do you like to volunteer? Thats another great way to meet people. &amp;#x200B; In the meantime (so long as your city is open for it right now) take yourself out on a few dates and be a tourist in your new city, there's usually lots to explore and ask people (ppl like cashiers, waitresses etc) what they would recommend doing, or good coffeeshops in the area.

t3_njql3w,How old are you and what age gap do you think is significant (platonic wise not necessarily dating)?,gz8tas7,"I'm in my 30s and i don't see there being a specific age gap that is universally significant. It depends on what the purpose/reasons are for the interactions. For example, I have many friends as part of a board game group that I joined 2 years ago. Attendees range anywhere from 18-40, sometimes someone brings along their 10yo kid, sometimes there's another family member brought along that's into their 50s and 60s. In these groups, we play a variety of games and split off into smaller gatherings depending on who wants to play what, so age isn't a factor. You can be immature and an ass at any age, and that's the only thing that causes issues. Making friends and meeting folks through gatherings like video games, DnD, and some other hobbies also kind of removes the element of age. How you behave and carry yourself matter most. As for actual dating purposes.. I'm going to go a bit against the grain and say that no age difference matters, \*as long as\* everyone is very open to communicate what the relationship is and isn't, and boundaries are set so that the power/maturity dynamic isn't brought into play. I have no worries about someone seeing someone half their age and keeping things relatively casual. I might not agree with or want it myself, but i don't fear for the younger party. Moving in together, making large purchases, becoming financially/emotionally dependent.. those are the kind of things which become huge flags and worry points for me.",1466

t3_no52k0,"ELI5: What are the differences between a database, data warehouse, data store, and a data lake? What types of software are used?",gzz4ooe,"Datastore: a digital place where you store data. This can be a database or even something as simple as a file. Database: a datastore with formally defined operations for creating, requesting, updating and deleting data. Databases come in a variety of flavors. Relational database: a database that not only stores data, but also stores the relations of that data. Data is generally stored in tables with rows and columns. The columns of the table generally describe the schema, or shape, of the data. The rows of the table generally represent individual records of the table. Tables can be linked or related to each other with ""foreign keys"". For example, an ""Order"" table might have a ""CustomerId"" column which is a foreign key for the ""Customer"" table, which relates the Order and Customer tables together. This gives you an incredible amount of flexibility in how you can query your data, as you can choose to join the two tables together on the foreign key and filter your data by any column from any of your joined tables. Nonrelational database: a database that avoids storing relational data. These are also known as ""NoSQL"" databases. These databases are generally much faster than relational databases, but come with the downside that querying data is much less flexible. It is still possible to relate data in a nonrelational database but it requires special consideration ahead of time to carefully design how your data will be indexed, partitioned and sorted.",1470

What did you do?,h00heaq,"When I first met my ex-girlfriend we were working together doing summer stock theater in a little town in New Hampshire called North Conway. Summer stock theater is both incredibly intensive and like a theater summer camp for adults. At least this summer was. We had a strange start to our relationship and it was supposed to be a summer thing only. About a month into hooking up we decided to take a day trip on one of our few days off and go to Portland, Maine to visit this hole in the wall seafood place that Anthony Bourdain said was amazing. I had no idea who Anthony Bourdain was at the time, I just liked to eat, but she was really into food and experiencing food. You know how people say that you should always travel with someone before you marry them? This was like a mini version of that. We hopped into her car and started driving, she had made an incredible mix full of music I had never heard before. It was hot and we were cruising with the windows down and the music blaring, laughing and talking about anything and everything. We took a few wrong turns, but it just made things more fun, not more stressful. We finally got to the place, J's Oysters, right in the harbor, snuggled up against the docks full of lobster boats. The whole night was incredible, we ate steamed clams and then had lobster, and had a few drinks and other appetizers. The food was absolutely incredible. Some of the best seafood I've ever had, and I grew up going to Maine every year to visit family. It felt like we were the only two people in the entire restaurant. We were there for a couple of hours, slowly eating and drinking and laughing. I absolutely, 100%, fell in love with her that night. I've never felt that comfortable with anyone, before or since. When we had our fill, we took a walk around Portland in the cool summer night with the breeze off the ocean. Then we drove back to North Conway, with the windows down and the summer breeze in our hair, holding hands and laughing and talking the whole way. We climbed into bed and fell asleep naked with the fan on and the window open, listening to the sound of peepers. By far the best date I have ever been on. We ended up being together for 7 years, and to this day she is one of my very closest friends.",2261

What is the number one tip you’d give to someone wanting to write a non-fiction book?,gwitbsc,"I had a professor once that tasked us with writing a description of a tree near our classroom and thirty or so students—including myself—all failed. In one way or another, either via personification or indulgent descriptions, the class as a whole failed the very simple and basic principle of presenting to the reader exactly what the writer/author is seeing/experiencing. My recommendation is twofold. 1. I belive nonfiction is an all-in gamble where you risk writing about something boring but present the material in a compelling and captivating way. Dont let the subject of your writing dissuade you; have confidence that your voice and attention to detail will carry your narrative. 2. Strive for a rich level of texture in your writing. Your topic, whatever it is, will have its own rich history that includes places, people and significant events that played a role in crafting its present state. Each of these should be seen as opportunities to fill in the world you are presenting to the reader so dont be afraid to stray from the main narrative to share an adjacent story that better develops the focus of your topic. To conclude I think that good writing paints a picture of reality but great writing erases the detectable brushstrokes of the written word. The more effort you put into the details the easier you make it for your readership to slip into and inhabit your story. Good luck and have fun.",1412

t3_n3qr0j,Just realized i dont have many hobbies... Any advice?,gwrjpaz,"I just found my hobby, it's growing and collecting mushrooms! I stumbled upon a mushroom cultivation timelapse video in youtube a while ago, seeing them grow into weird shapes from microscopic spores is amazing. So I looked for more, that's when I fell in the rabbit hole. Getting into mushrooms stuff, or mycology, is easy, although not as easy as getting a small plant, planning ahead and patience is the key to quality mushroom. The majority of mushrooms/fungi are quite suitable for indoor cultivation, they can be very low maintenance if the environment is accomodating enough. If you are fascinated by fungi's diversity and how unique some mushrooms look, and growing has been a success, then you're ready for the next level. That's harvesting, isolating, and even mixing the genes of mushrooms you find interesting. This means you can end up with a strain that grows super fast, or one that has unique colors, or one that's just big. Since the lifecycle of mushrooms are fairly short, the influence of selective cultivation can be visible in a relatively very short timeframe, when compared to animals and plants. Also I noticed you make music from the post, MycoLyco[MycoLyco](https://youtu.be/J-nIBA0V_No) from youtube uses mushroom as his instrument to play MIDI, so that's cool. Some mushrooms can be grown for food, for medicinal use or just for the view. There's quite a few awesome subreddits (such as r/mycology, r/mushroomgrowers) and youtube channels ([Philly Golden Teacher](https://youtube.com/c/PhillyGoldenTeacher), [90 Second Mycology](https://youtube.com/c/90SecondMycology)) that have a lot of information on this subject, as well as people who are more than happy to help others learn. I'm actually pretty new to this myself (hopefully I got everything right), but a few weeks of exposure and some light research really got me hooked. Hope you find the hobby you're looking for soon!",1908

If the hiring manager thinks you are the perfect fit, they will adjust the title of the position to fit your qualifications, but I haven't seen this happen much. You can slowly work your way up. However, I think this will be less likely than it used to be just because there are so many PhDs now. My potential new manager is one such person who slowly worked their way up to research fellow. It is still not easy getting into industry with a PhD. I would recommend applying to some place like Biogen (still does a lot of neuroscience work) and see where you get.

If so, how?",gx5pffa,"This may not be exactly what you’re looking for, but this concept is important in sports psychology. You do exactly the thing you’re trying not to do all the time, because the subconscious mind (which is in charge of coordinating your movements) doesn’t understand negative instructions. “Just don’t overshoot it”, or “just don’t slice this drive,” or “just don’t kick it straight at the goalkeeper” are not thoughts the mind can turn into actions. When you think “don’t kick it to the goalkeeper” your subconscious doesn’t know what to do with that, but it does respond to the fact that you’re focusing on and visualizing kicking it to the goalkeeper. So lo and behold, that’s exactly what you do. The only productive thoughts are positive instructions; you have to think about what you want to do, never about what not to do. Visualize your penalty kick going into a specific corner of the goal, or your golf swing arcing inside-to-outside to draw instead of slicing, or visualize the cue ball rolling at the desired speed into the position zone.

Consciousness allows us to keep a train of thought and stay focused on a problem, but almost everything else the brain does without conscious interference. In fact, it's been demonstrated that our brains start to act before our consciousness enters into play. Your brain already decided to get this for lunch or make that for dinner before you were consciously aware of making the decision. When ""something random just occurred to you"" your brain put together information in the background of your mind and decided ""hey, you should think about this"" and presented it to your conscious mind. It's like how you might be distracted driving but your attention snaps back to the road when something iffy happens cause your peripheral senses, while you were distracted, were still paying attention and got your conscious attention as soon as the information they processed meant something was wrong. Another example is how people with certain types of blindness are able to walk around objects naturally if they're distracted.

We went camping, it was all quite fun, until it got dark. For dinner we prepared salad and grilled meat, but once we finished, my father and I took care of ordering some things while my sister went to wash the dishes. About 5 minutes passed and my sister came back, trembling and completely pale, and asked me to please accompany her, because she did not feel safe in the sink (I must add that there was a common sink where everyone went to wash dirty things, so it was a bit far from where we were camping. Not too far, but a bit). After telling her not to be so scared, I decided to accompany her because she didn't wanted to go alone. As we approached the sink it was completely dark, so I had to approach with a flashlight. As I got closer I saw that there were spiders on the sink, at that moment I turned to laugh, thinking that it was the spiders that had scared my sister. I approached again and when I was about to crush one of the spiders, a shadow of what seemed about 2 meters passed extremely fast behind the sink, hiding behind (and I say that it was very fast, at a speed impossible for a normal human). Obviously I was scared and I approached with the flashlight to check what that had been, but there was nothing. I turned around to see if my sister had also seen what I had, and I only saw her again pale, trembling and with wide eyes. I looked again in the direction of the sink to now realize that the figure was now about 5 meters from where we were, totally still. It looked like the figure of a normal person, except that it was very tall and was completely dark (although I pointed the flashlight at it). We both looked at each other, saying with our eyes: ""We must get out of here quickly."" Just at that moment the figure began to move towards us, so we instantly ran out of there. We went back to our dad and we told him everything, he got angry with us and went to wash by himself, and when he came back he told us that he did not know what we were talking about, and that he had not seen anything in the sink. At the time of writing this I asked my sister if she could remember all this, and she just looked at me with wide eyes and left the room without saying a single word to me.

t3_n7ge69,"How would Marx and other prominent Communist philosophers react to ""people seeking out communism to expand their privilege"" and is luxary inherently against communist goals ?",gxd703o,"Moishe Postone posits in his book Time, Labor, and Social Domination that orthodox Marxists had the trouble of reaffirming the superficial Marxian understanding of labor as a trans-historical category guiding social development. He says that this is mistaken, as the method of Marxism (immanent dialectical critique) expresses categories of social analysis only as far as they are aligned with the current historical period: when we consider that socialism is an expansion and improvement upon capitalist productivity and industrialism by way of social planning, we forget that what Marx was ultimately critiquing is the status of *labor* in capitalist society, which is growing increasingly anachronistic to society as the productivity and processes of social reproduction become defined by things increasingly removed from labor. All of this is to say that post-capitalism should be defined not only by a transformation of the capabilities of production, but also as a wide transformation of work and labor. Labor under socialism (which I use interchangeably with communism) is much more enriching to individuals. So, communism ultimately implies a society more in line with the will of people and their desire unimpeded by the capitalist production process. There isn’t a class of people who “benefit” the most from socialism because socialism has no classes.

t3_n7g2z9,ELI5 - How does a Boomerang work?,gxcooaa,"http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/brng.html I’m going to try my best to interpret here: basically a boomerang is built to have an aerofoil (wing) always at the top edge of the object. An aerofoil causes air to move faster around it, which creates lift. What this accomplishes is that the boomerang is pushed to the left (most boomerangs I’ve seen are left-rotating) from whatever direction it is parallel to. If you get enough spin that that aerofoil turns through enough air to push it just at the right rate and right amount, you can get it to come right back to you. Otherwise it whizzes past you and you duck anyways. This is my basic understanding. I may be wrong, at parts, but I know for a fact that the boomerang is shaped like a plane’s wing, and instead of getting lift upwards it gets most of the lift normal to the boomerang as torque.",856

DBT therapy taught me some skills on grounding yourself and keeping yourself mindful . when you're anxious , find something in front of you that has words on it and read the words out loud and then start to read the letters backwards one by one for example , the dog walks in the park you would go k r a p e h t etc. grab an object like an orange and pretend you never saw an orange before and examine it how does it feel how does it smell how does it taste how does it look visualization can work too I like to imagine im sitting near a river and the river is flowing and moving a million miles an hour and im sitting on the grass and I can feel the grass beneath me tickling my body , I run my hands through the grass and its soft and I want to take out the knots in the grass and make it smooth, I watch the river run and imagine my thoughts are apart of the river , I might think of a bad breakup , ill see him and our fights and acknowledge that it happened and like the river flows , ill let it flow with the river and out of my head.",1554

t3_na0e43,ELI5: How do chip companies disable specific parts of a CPU or GPU to create different SKUs?,gxqsbc4,"It depends [Clock gating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_gating) is a common method, you basically flip a transistor so that it blocks the clock signal going to a portion of the chip, this prevents the chip from sending data in or out of that section. This is done in the microcode on the chip and if you have 10 blocks and need to disable 2 this lets you disable 1&amp;2 or 3&amp;7 or any combination you need to and the chip will steer traffic around that For defects that might be more problematic for the chip if physically left in, sometimes a portion of the chip is physically lasered out to physically remove the connections between the damaged portion and the rest of the chip. The microcode will then be told to ignore these portions just as above with clock gating so it can steer traffic accordingly. Lasering is a much more permanent solution while the microcode disabling can sometimes be bypassed which was fairly common about a decade ago with AMD's Phenom II dual and triple core chips which could sometimes be ""unlocked"" into quad core chips.",1064

t3_nbakbg,Can you have more than one agent?,gxybmwr,"So, there are situations where people have more than one agent (at the same time). Off the top of my head, a couple of examples would be: –when you're branched out into new genres/categories the original agent does not rep/does not wish to rep. –your agent is in the UK/US but does not work with co-agents in the US/UK, so you get a seperate agent on the opposite side of the pond. But from what you've said, this doesn't apply to you. It sounds like you have a case of 'the grass is greener'. You have an agent, they've sold (or are shopping) your work (so those manuscripts remain with them), but now you want an additional agent for new work.... am I getting the gist right? In this scenario, you are unlikely to be able to have 2 agents. After all, your agent gets a cut of what they sell, so how would that work with 2 agents? Are you planning to cut your original agent out of new deals? Because, why would they be okay with that? Likewise, why would the new agent want a second voice in the mix? Are you even willing to give them both 15% a piece? So essentially, you have to choose: stay with your original agent, or allow yourself to get poached (it sounds like new agent approached you?) and hope it goes every bit as well as you expect it to and that the new doors open. The fact is, writers change agents all the time. Yes, in a perfect world, the first agent you land with is your perfect fit and you both enjoy a career long partnership. In the real world, this rarely happens. But it's a gamble to move agents when everything is going well - so the real question is: what makes you think new agent is going to open more doors?",1641

t3_ndtdu9,ELI5: Is there a reason we have 2 nostrils?,gyci449,"Short answer - This gives us a better range of smell. Long answer - 2 nostrils effectively act like two noses. Due to some biological mechanics, usually one nostril allows less air to pass through than the other, with the nasal flow switching every few hours. The sensory cells in our nose sometimes require more time to identify certain odors, and a low-airflow nostril gives them more time to be detected, giving us a better ability to detect scents.

It wasn't normal looking, tho. It was more like a hologram of a head, like there was no color to it. Just lighting and shading. Almost like if you could mold smoke into the shape of a human head. I'd remember the guy's face if I ever saw him in person, too. He had a long thin face, high prominent cheek bones, kind of almond shaped slanted eyes and he had long hair pulled back by a bandana or head scarf or something.

t3_ndvlnj,How would I go about redoing my bachelors?,gycy5pm,"Look for post-baccalaureate programs. You don't need to re-do an entire degree or do an entirely new undergrad. Pick a school that allows you to only take the courses that are required for the BA/BS in the new field you want to study, then only do those courses. Trust me, the more recent your good GPA and distant your old GPA will make a huge difference. Also, make sure to network with possible mentors to get onto undergrad research projects--these contacts will help you get into a graduate program and the newer, better GPA will be weighted much more than an older, worse GPA. When applying to graduate schools, your letter on intent can include 1-2 sentences about the low GPA (you don't have to go into specifics) and how you have turned things around and done super awesome since then by applying yourself and learning from past missteps. One other suggestion--try to take a few graduate courses while still doing undergrad (there may be some split courses--where both grad and undergrad students are split-listed in the class). This will prove that you can succeed in graduate-level courses. I did a post-baccalaureate in a STEM field, followed my own advice above and didn't even finish the post-bacc before getting admitted to the masters program in the same department. Most post-baccs take 12-24 months, but depends on how many core/prereq classes you need for the new degree. You graduate admission will weight the most recent GPA, but you will have to provide all college/university degrees in the application. Most state colleges and universities will enroll you as a ""Second BA/BS"" and others may refer to you as a post-bacc. I preferred referring to myself as a post-bacc. I spent 2 years taking more math, more chem and physics, on top of the major required courses. Then transitioned to the master's, taking graduate courses that transferred into my master's in the last half of my second year. All courses were FAFSA funded until the university/program started fully funding me with teaching and research assistantships that covered all enrollment costs and paid me a stipend.",2098

t3_nf8h4p,What are the bounds of self-overcoming in power relationships?,gyl0mig,"I think you are posing some excellent questions. By which I mean, you are posing questions that indicate a high level of interpretive engagement with the text. Since there is so much going on here, and because my preference is to make brief comments, I'm going to focus on just one of the questions you raise here - the first one (the main one?) regarding ""is it self-overcoming to deny one's own will to enact themselves if it in turn means holding to a higher principle they've established for themselves (etc)."" Of course, I understand this question as an elucidation of the concerns articulated in your entire second paragraph. What strikes me about this tenor of questioning is that it seems to take the Nietzschean will (or ""self,"" or ""soul"") to be something that could be (""in principle"" as it were) definitively established. As if we could know what it meant to ""enact the will."" Then, once the domain of the will has been definitively established, we can contrast it usefully with whatever concerns do not reside within the domain of the will (let's say, concern relating to some extraneous moral law or ideology) and introduce the worry that we aren't acting within the proper domain like good Nietzscheans. Probably you already have a sense of how this way of conceptualizing matters is problematic. The will is \_not\_, to begin with, a unified, given thing with an identifiable goal that we can seek to actualize. If only it were this would obviate all the difficult work that Nietzsche thinks we have ahead of us. A silly analogy. I'm reading an interesting book when it dawns on me that I'm getting hungry. And in that moment I find myself with two irreconcilable drives: a drive to continue reading and a drive to put the book down and make something to eat. It seems clear that, at least temporarily, one of these drives is going to have to be subsumed to the other. Perhaps the answer lies in one drive brutishly overpowering the other ""in the heat of the moment."" Perhaps the answer lies in appealing to a ""higher"" drive (a drive for ""reason,"" say) to adjudicate the matter on behalf of both. So, to extend the analogy I suspect that at least some of your questions could be more usefully conceptualized as attempts to reconcile conflicting aspects of the will, rather than as the pitting of the will (as if it were something already unified) against something else. Self-overcoming is precisely this process of continuous re-integration of conflicting drives. It is substantively *introspective* work that is not related that much to the external environment or whatever except insofar as that environment place us in certain circumstances. Re-read the preface to On the Genealogy of Morals. Nietzsche talks a lot there about the importance of striving for a kind of structural integrity (which straightforwardly suggests that this integrity does not really exist in the self except as an ideal we strive toward). Lastly, I will try to anticipate a possible criticism. It may sound like I'm saying ""hey there is nothing wrong with being an unreflective consumer/capitalist - that's just one aspect of your will LOL."" But the essential thing here for proper self-overcoming is that there is a (legit) striving for unity going on. If there is no striving for unity, no attempt to adjudicate conflicts in the light of some higher purpose, if it's just one drive overpowering another in a way that is left to happenstance then there is no self-overcoming going on. There is, in fact, scarcely a self worth acknowledging in such a picture.",3554

Silicone negatively impacts the absorbency of the fabric because most silicones are hydrophobic (water repellent). Fortunately, much of the silicone washes off when you wash your towels.

A couple can revisit these to has them out again, even if they don't change; or, they can be left along.

A common way is the X.Y.Z variant. X is the major version number. Y in the minor version number. Z is the patch. So X changes when you consider is major changes. It might be that non backwards compatible charges, other major chages or just that you do that because you charge for uppdates to new major version. Y change when you do minor changes to the software. Z changes when you fix bugs or similar small changes. But that is just a common way to do it. As a developer you can do it anyway you like. You could release software and decrease the number start at 100 and next version is 99. It might be stupid thing to do and it confuse people that use it but you could do it There can be requirement of what to do if you use some external services like app stores to distribute the software so updates etc works",900

I felt really dumb in class when I couldn't get an answer right and considered dropping the class, it was my last year at high school, but I thought that it was too important of a subject not to learn. The head of the math department was fairly new and wasn't originally from our school, she had only been in the job like a week or something. She came into our class after the test to see how we'd done and basically accused me of not trying hard enough in front of everyone because they had higher scores than me. They knew I was struggling with this shit and yet my teacher never stood up for me. I was never one to talk back so I just sat there in silence as she ranted about how I was lazy and unwilling to learn, despite only being at the school for such a short time. I was pissed. Needless to say I never passed that class. The tutor I had was organised by family, the school never stepped in at all to give me support.",1045

t3_njcik5,ELI5: How was the very first computer able to understand commands? How did they code a system to understand code in the first place?,gz6kqsv,"The very first computers didn't understand computer code, they were programmed by hand using a series of switches. The famous Bronze Goddesses used to decode enigma during WW2 were programmed manually in this way. But you could argue they weren't true computers yet, as they were mono-task devices. Programming computers by hand was inefficient and impractical so the concept of the computer language was invented to be able to quickly program computers to perform repeatable tasks. Assembly languages were developed in the late 1940's which were the first computer languages. The computer processors were designed in parallel with the language in the same way that you design a car with a steering wheel and pedals otherwise you wouldn't have a way of driving it. The limits of assembler however is that you need an extremely high degree of understanding of computers and their operation to use it. It isn't practical for anything but the most basic of functions. To make computers do more we invented high-level programming languages that would act as an interface between humans and complex computer logic. Essentially creating a tool that allowed humans to write the logic (a computer program) and then translate it into assembler using a tool called a compiller. The first such language was IBMs FORTRAN created in the late 50's. Higher level languages like C came much much later. The compilers of those languages transform the easier to read code into assembler (machine code) underneath that the processor can understand. Modern languages like HTML, PhP, JAVA etc go a step further in that they produce code meant to be translated by an intermediary program, which in many cases is the browser. The browser in this case is the interface that transforms web code into machine language.",1792

t3_nkki4f,ELI5 : How are videogame codes protected ?,gzfea7n,"Some of the explanations on here are going into a separate issue (recovering source code). This really has nothing to do with what OP is asking. OP you are right that in theory a program can be transferred to other computers simply by transferring all the files. In fact this is exactly what people used to do back in the day and it worked. I remember when software companies started to require a serial number (usually found on the physical packaging). You would need a valid serial number or the software wouldn’t run. At first, software would check that a serial number was valid based on an algorithm it ran itself. Later when the internet became prevalent, software would require an online validation of a serial number. Now that most software does not come in a physical box, the protections are all happening behind the scenes I would assume. I’m sure any major software company has piracy protection built into their software. So to answer your question, yes it is possible in concept but highly illegal and most software has hidden protections to prevent you from successfully doing this.",1097
t3_nkkmw8,Should scalping be illegal? Why/why not?,gzdc64n,"Yes. A limited product shouldn't bought to be price gouged. Again I veto bots auto buying the stock, and also set a limit on how many people can buy something. Reality that will never hold enough ground. Why? Limited things are limited. They will only appreciate in value over time which is frustrating but not immoral. However a shortage based things will gradually zero out after new supply is induced into the market. A good example is people were casuing gas shortage and then scalping gas by selling it 5 times the msrp for profit. I myself have scalped/flipped things. However it never is a public necessity. Nor a shortage based item. Rather limited edition/classics no longer in production. Buy cheap sell high to buyers who are willing to pay such premiums. I usually will enjoy the item before I grew bored of it. My dream is to one day own a 964 Porsche n Ford GT, but the reality is they are limited n prices always increasing. Hence I will never be able to obtain it. That isn't scalping just a limited item out of production",1038

My roomie went to the grocery store and got fresh fruit and stuff, I got out my freshbox and made her a big bunch of pancakes, chocolate sauce, filled a small bottle with syrup, my roomie made fruit salat and prepared berries. We packed the hot pancakes into the freshbox so they'd stay hot, packed a small mini table, some silverware, my best plates and a pretty kitchen towel and went over right in time for her break.

Some precious metal dealers maintain a small inventory which they use to be on one or the other side of a trade, but for the most part, even that is designed to be a way to bring buyers and sellers together rather than an actual investment the dealer uses to make money. It's more nuanced of course, but better to make a buck on each of 10,000 hundred dollar trades every week (whether prices are rising or falling) than than buy a million dollars worth of assets today and hope you can sell them for $1,010,000 next week.",1014

Jack Vance is one of my favorite authors, and he was a legendary master of the supererogatory phrase. On the other hand, Lord Dunsany puts me into a coma, and Mark Twain used purple prose as a practical joke on his readers in the opening of ""A Double-Barreled Detective Story"": ""It was a crisp and spicy morning in early October. The lilacs and laburnums, lit with the glory-fires of autumn, hung burning and flashing in the upper air, a fairy bridge provided by kind nature for the wingless wild things that have their home in the tree-tops and would visit together; the larch and the pomegranate flung their purple and yellow flames in brilliant broad splashes along the slanting sweep of woodland, the sensuous fragrance of innumerable deciduous flowers rose upon the swooning atmosphere, far in the empty sky a solitary oesophagus slept upon motionless wing; everywhere brooded stillness, serenity, and the peace of God."" The idea was that hardly anyone would have the stamina to make it all the way to ""far in the sky a solitary oesophagus slept upon motionless wing,"" and would skip to the next paragraph without ever wondering what the heck Twain was talking about.

Is that correct? Consider taking some time for your other hobbies, the ones you set aside for writing. Spend time there and let your mind work up to the last few chapters of your book. Make notes when you think of something, and when you've had a break, dive back in. I know you want to get this done, but don't be too hard on yourself if it takes longer than you think it should.

t3_n2qa4v,"People who experienced a very traumatic event while very young, what do you remember from it?",gwlafla,"TW/sexual abuse (?) My (F20) family visited my paternal aunt and her sons in Paris when I was 8 I think. I was left at home with my big and small cousin and the little one played a game on his console. Me and the big cousin(M 12) went down to the backyard to play, then he proceeded to pull his pants down and peed on a wall which I didn't find *too* weird, after this he tried to pee on me and I had to actively run around and dodge it. I thiught that was it with the weird stuff as that was hibestly the weirdest shit I had ever experienced at that time but then he told me it was time for me to try this other game and suck his cock. I was really weirded out even though I didn't understand what a blowjob was at the time so I said no, I don't want to play that game. He started chasing me and telling me how it wouldn't take long and that I should listen to him as he is the older one. I just was panicked and disgusted that he wanted me to suck the place his piss just came out of and ran as fast as I could in circles on that damn backyard at first, then climbing the steps as fast as I could with him still following behind me, but I fortunatly was faster then him. I arrived at the door and knocked loudly in hopes of being let in by my little cousin and shouting for him to open up the door please, but something even better happened, instead of my little cousin my aunt opened the door, she came back to care for us now while my parents had a date in Paris with my little sis who was just like three at the time. She greeted me and asked why I was so out of breath and I just could say my cousins name and felt so ashamed that I couldn't say anything more. He came to us around then, he took more time than he should've but that was because he heard his mom talk to me and rebuttoned his pants so there was no proof. His mother asked him what he had done and he told her we were just playing a game of catch. I asked my aunt when my parents are gonna come and she told me mom and dad booked a suite for the night in a hotel and were only coming back tomorrow. She then proceeded to give my big cousin some pocket money because of how he cared *so well* for his brother and I, it was a 20€ bill. I had to sleep in the same room as my two cousins that night, fortunately in my own bed. My cousin whispered to me that I should keep quiet and not ever tell anyone about what happened. Oh and the sweet angel little cousin asked him 'what' so innocently so I just said that 'there was nothing' and he should 'go to sleep'. 7 nights I had to spend at that place, when my parents came back we all were there together and I felt pretty safe again, but every night we had to go to sleep in that room I tucked my sister in tightly beside me in our bed and hugged her. My big cousin asked her if she wanted to come to him but I just shut him down and didn't tell her what he said apart from that he just made a joke. My dad's family speaks french and my sister didn't quite understamd that yet, I was raised bilingual though so I kinda was like the translator for my little sister. I waited every night until he fell asleep before I could even think of closing my eyes in fear of him doing anything to my sister. After this he never made any advances ever again and the next time I saw him I was doing martial arts for a couple of years and felt fairly confident. I actually didn't even think about what he did as it was years ago, I was like 12 or 13 at this point. I saw him maybe 3 more times after this but since had not even had contact via social media. I never talked to my parents about this, only my boyfriend and my ex boyfriend know about this story. Sometimes it pops up in my head at random times, the way he grinned at me when telling me that I should just do it for a bit whilst he was chasing me around, sometimes it keeps me up at night and sometimes I just don't think of it at all. The most heartbreaking thing here for me was that previous to our Paris trip I genuinely missed my cousins and was really glad to get to see them again. The little one was an angel for the whole time. I thought of my big cousin as a big brother figure that I didn't have (I had two other big cousins in my home country too but I always wanted to have a big brother figure and my cousins filled that place for me). This is why I have this burning hate for any type of sexual offenders. No means no. Maybe is a no. Silence is a no. Especially if KIDS are involved.",4462

When I cleared off the phone voice mail, I found a 12 minute message from the girl who had settled out of court for a large sum of money. To this day I don't know if it was a butt dial or if it was deliberately done, but the message had the shit head VP and this girl going through a McD's drive through ordering food and talking about how they had scammed the company out of the funds. Apparently they split the funds.",869

I can pull cash out and use that. Costco said, that’s ok. But my card is magically the no no zone. I started asking them if I had a visa gift card if I could use that just to mess with them. These rules are archaic and with no substance. I get they want individuals to pay for memberships. That’s fine. But my wife(the member) was literally splitting the bill between her card and mine.

I went, and there was a lull so I sat myself at the side and was checking something on my phone as the comedian came out. He first told the bar to ""shut the fuck up, it's my time now"" which went...brilliantly as you'd expect in a room full of half-drunk military personnel. He then spotted me, and started kicking off that I should be paying attention to his act. To be clear: this was a 1 hour set, not the actual event we're there for. He started going off on my clothes, my hair, my weight (Overweight, pre-transition transgender...) and I was just...shocked. Couldn't respond, being called out in front of like 100 coworkers.

t3_n5gnyl,ELI5 The difference between genetically and biologically of the human body?,gx167mv,"Sex as a biological category is complicated. In humans, cells typically contain 23 pairs of chromosomes, 23 inherited from your dad and 23 inherited from your mother. The first 22 pairs are what we call autosomes, and where the chromosomes in an individual pair are practically identical. The last pair of chromosomes is what we refer to as sex chromosomes. There are two types of sex chromosomes in humans, namely the X-chromosome and the Y-chromosome. Our gametes (sperm and eggs) are haploid, meaning they only have 23 chromosomes. Gametes have to be haploid because they fuse with the gamete of another person during fertilization to produce a diploid zygote with 23 pairs of chromosomes. Gametes are produced by germs cells located in the gonads, namely the testicles and the ovaries. Germ cells are diploid and to create a haploid gamete they have to go through a process of cell replication and division called Meiosis. During meiosis, a process called crossing over occurs, where genetic material (genes) are swapped between chromosomal pairs in the cell. This is one of the processes that ensure genetic diversity in humans. What can occur here is that the SRY-gene found on the y-chromosome can be transferred over to an x-chromosome, resulting in a person with two X-chromosomes having the SRY-gene. The SRY-gene is responsible for the activation of male sexual differentiation during early pregnancy. This means that you can be genetically female, while having a functioning SRY-gene, resulting in the development of a male reproductive system. There are also many other factors that play into sex differentiation in humans including the external environment, epigenetics, and so on.",1695
t3_n5g56j,How do I make the best of my Master's journey?,gx10mgj,"There’s so much to know! I’m finishing my Masters now and start at a top PhD program this Fall. Here’s my advice: 1. Treat it like a 9-5 from day one. If you don’t have ‘that much work to do’ then fill your days with a) reading journal articles on topics that interest you b) beginning to draft papers c) learning programs like SPSS and R that you will need in the future anyways. 2. Come up with a timeline and agree on it with your supervisor. This should include a) when your thesis proposal will be ready b) ethics c) data collection d) first draft of your thesis. Structure it around any goals or deadlines that will help you build your CV such as a conference paper or poster. 3. When you have courses, always do your papers on topics that relate to your thesis or other research interests. You’ll be able to reuse a lot this way. 4. To make yourself a strong PhD application you need demonstrated research experience. Conferences and publications help. Conferences are much, much easier to get under your belt than publications. Present your work any time you have the chance; you’re at the level where even small, local conferences look great on your CV. 5. If you need test scores to be admitted to programs for PhD start studying now. Speaking as someone from a related field (Masters in Organizational Behaviour) being in graduate school builds your reading comprehension and verbal skills massively but your math skills will falter because data analysis and statistics is nothing like the math on the GRE or GMAT. You’ll lose your math quicker than you think so keep those up if you need to take those exams. 6. Having friends outside of graduate school is as essential as having friends inside graduate school. Grad school can be lonely; you need people who understand your experience but you also need people on the outside who can be happy for you without being in competition with you for any of the same awards or scholarships. 7. Talk to your supervisors and research office about scholarships and awards right now. Put the requirements and dates in your calendar. These also look great on PhD applications. 8. Focus on your thesis. It’s ok to take on some research assistant work and side projects but never at the expense of your thesis. You wouldn’t believe how many people do not finish in 2 years because they’re so caught up in other research or projects that their supervisor asked them to help with. 9. Use referencing software from day 1. Zotero or Mendeley - doesn’t matter, just use one. 10. Make friends with the research librarians. Go to them for help. They’re a wealth of knowledge and will save you so much time. Good luck!",2657

t3_n6em1i,ELI5 How did scientist find out about the planets in our solar system?,gx6n0ra,"Most of the planets in our solar system were actually discovered hundreds of years ago because they can be seen with the naked eye. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn can all be seen just by looking up at the stars and seeing which ones move. Our word planet actually comes from greek, meaning wanderer, because planets look like stars that change positions. The other two planets, Uranus and Neptune, were discovered by optical telescopes. There a lot of math you can do to figure out where these planets are by observing gravitational effects, but it really boils down to just watching the sky through a telescope. Astronomy is mostly just picking out a section of sky and recording everything you see for days on end. If something moves, then you've potentially found a new planet, asteroid, comet, or dwarf planet. Hundreds of years of these observations from all over the world has resulted in us cataloging thousands upon thousands of items in our own solar system.",977

It wasnt stained but the kid must be tired and the act of changing clothes agitated him. My friend didnt take the son to the back and calmed him down. She just kept shushing him to no avail.

It was definitely one of the most impressive and enjoyable things I've read all last year. Also, a great deal of this is truly given over to nonfiction writings. Cicero, Caesar, Sallust, Pliny, Seneca, Quintilian, Tacitus, Suetonius, St. Augustine, and Tertullian were all featured. One thing I particularly appreciated was that a range of eras were represented by the translations all the way back to the Elizabethan, so you not only got a sense of Roman literature over time but also how English translators responded to it in their various ways. If you define ""past year"" as ""past calendar year"" instead of ""year to date"", then I can also recommend Suetonius particularly, because I reread his *The Twelve Caesars* last February before seeing *Agrippina* by Händel, the last Metropolitan Opera broadcast in theatres before the shutdown.",1045
t3_na68w3,What was your worst group work experience for school/work/projects/college/anything?,gxruay5,"I was in a Film and Video class in high school. End of the year group project, I got paired with a friend of mine and a girl I had slept with when she had a boyfriend, only time I ever did that. Her boyfriend jumped me, we fought it out, talked it out afterwards, didn't become friends but he stayed with her and we were cool; all happened prior to the project. Needless to say I didn't want to be doing a project with her, but I had no choice at that point. So we get together for the project, and halfway through filming some other kids in the course destroy all the decent cameras the class had just for shiggles. All we had left was 2 extremely old and low quality cameras, rendering all our existing footage useless because we couldn't get the same resolution as before, not even half. So we refilm with what little time we have and end up doing a *very* shitty, on-the-spot serial killer story in some nearby woods that you can't decipher through the 320x200 or whatever we had resolution. So we know we have a bum, illegible project, but even though we couldn't change that we still had to attempt to edit it as that was part of the grading. Girl says we should do it at her house, we couldn't edit at the school (I can't remember what the issue was there) so I agreed but I made it very clear to the friend that I couldn't be alone with her because of what had happened between us before. He assured me he'd be there, couldn't miss the points on the project, right? Well I show up there at lunch time and he's a no show, so its just me and this girl I absolutely shouldn't be alone with. She'd made passes at me after the thing between her boyfriend and myself happened, so I don't want to be there at all, but she doesn't know how to edit and with my buddy not showing up I was the only one who could edit, so I tried to edit the whole thing alone before lunch ended. I was sitting on the couch with her laptop editing away when I see a yellow sunfire pull up in the driveway, her boyfriend's car. *Fuck.* She starts screaming at me to run out the backdoor into the woods and I tell her no goddamn way am I bolting out like we were doing something wrong, it'll just make the situation worse. I plopped back down on the couch and went back to editing. He came in, saw my shoes and was obviously not happy. She went down to the landing to talk him down and I called down something like 'Look I'm just trying to not fucking fail F&amp;V' and they went downstairs to talk it out. I threw on some 3 Inches of Blood to drown it out and edited the video alone while they argued. We passed the project at least, the teacher was a fantastic guy (RIP) and basically passed anyone who put any effort into their project seeing as he couldn't really watch any of the videos that were handed in.",2790

Blasters are more powerful so their personal energy shields are no longer a practical piece of kit to wear, droids are pretty much the same but given the fears of a droid uprising (something that's happened at least once before) that's understandable if there's certain limits placed on technology, the Sith Interdictor cruisers Revan and Malak's Sith Empire used so extensively can pull ships from the Old Republic out of hyperspace but they can't do the same thing to later ships while the Empire built a class of different better Interdictor cruisers and star destroyers. With space combat they still use the same weapons and defences more or less but the difference in firepower and durability is incredible so that while Malak needed an entire fleet to destroy Taris a single Imperial Star Destroyer could accomplish the same task, or even an Acclamator assault ship (although it'd take longer).",1374

Additionally, you have all the businesses you'd have to buy, etc etc. So if you paid the entire state's gdp, you'd have to fork out an additional about $195 billion. Just between those 2, you're already at almost half a trillion dollars. But then you'd have to purchase all the homes from people, which could run you another few hundred billion dollars.

In fantasy - which I'm fairly new to - I like Robin Hobb &amp; her 3x trilogy Farseer/Tawny Man/Fitz &amp; The Fool \[9 books\]. There is a relationship in these books between the two main characters that is so interesting, ambiguous and complex that you can't wait to read the next intense conversation between them.

t3_nd1c3x,How to write a likeable main character?,gy857nu,"Add complexity by testing her. When is she not ""nice""? Are there limits? Do people take advantage of her niceness? Her friends, her rivals? Does she know? How does it make her feel? Does she feel she should change it? Has she tried to change it before? Does this relate to her ""B plot"" of character transformation over time? What does ""nice"" mean? Can you get more nuanced? For instance if she is kind and giving, is she also considerate and remember everyone's birthday every single time? If she has every possible positive quality, maybe you can pare it down so she is laudable but not complete. Some people are honest but harsh. Some people are loving but not thoughtful (won't think to help until asked to). Maybe you can add some shades here to get more mileage out of being nice. She could save a cat. If you're unaware this is a term from screenwriter Blake Snyder about how to remedy unlikable characters - perhaps so that you stick with them long enough for them to do their arc and become likeable. They should save a cat (literally or metaphorically- do an otherwise pointless good deed on camera) so the audience goes ""oh. Well I thought they were shit but I guess there must be something else going on there"").",1223

t3_nfpei4,"ELI5 How is money ""pumped"" into the economy to cause inflation?",gyn8nr8,"The more of something there is the less valuable it is. It's basically supply and demand, but I suspect that your question is more asking about the principals of supply and demand. Salt in some ancient cultures was used as a currency because it was rare in bulk form and had a lot of practical use. That can work as a currency so long as the general amount of salt stays consistent within the economy. If too many people eat the salt, then that means there is less salt in the economy. If I were to want to obtain a pound of salt, it would be harder to do than before simply because there is less of it. The people who have the salt will catch on to this and trade with you but at a higher price than before. This is deflation. Where it gets interesting is that some people may decline trading their salt because they'd prefer to hold on to it and trade it at a higher value, which in effect decreases the supply of salt in the economy which drives up the price even more. If George comes across a giant salt deposit, he'll trade it with others. As the salt disperses into the economy, people will have less need/want for it because they will be able to obtain it much easier, and so they'll stop asking as much for it. A big part of this is that people who have too much will be bidding down others. The trade value of the salt goes down. Where it gets interesting is that the people who trade that new currency first get the most benefit from it. George was making trades before the prices adjusted, while others are paying an inflated price with no benefit to them. People who were stockpiling on salt because they thought it'd only go up in value have now become a lot richer. To really hammer the point, I really like sour patch kids. If someone wants to trade me 1 bag for a 50 cents, I'll do it. 2 for $1, yes. 5 for $2.50, maybe, but maybe $2.25. 30 for $15.00, I mean it is a good deal, but I really don't need that many, maybe for 10.00. 100 for $50.00, I mean I really like them, maybe for $25.00 but I don't know what I'd do with them and trying to sell them at a markup to someone else would be annoying so no thanks. The above is a poorly illustrated example of how increase supply can affect price. From a distance, price comes down to supply and demand. The more of something is the less valuable it will be, and vice versa. Demand is similar, you can have something that is of very low supply but nobody may want it, like jars of pickled beetle penises. Monetary economics can use this relationship by simply printing more money. Money is abstract, unlike gold, and can be created. This will eventually cause prices to increase as there is a greater supply. This can also increase spending in general, because if someone expects the value of their dollar to go down, it makes sense to spend it while it is more valuable. A point can be made that there are some currencies that are better than others. There's a story of some colony that used tobacco as a currency. It worked out alright until they figured out how to make tons of tobacco and people lost all their savings. There is only so much tobacco that can be useful. Some things like gold are generally more stable because you can't easily make more of it and its hard to destroy. It's still susceptible to inflation though, like if you stumble across a giant gold deposit. Fiat currency is a double edged sword, if you manage it well it can be fine, but as shown by a lot of countries it is easy to mess up and cause hyperinflation.",3506

t3_nh0nmo,ELI5: Why does cornstarch or other grain slurries thicken sauces?,gytr4dm,"Starch is made up of long chains of glucose sugar molecules joined together, to form a huge string. There are actually two types of starch; amylose and amylopectin. In amylose, all the glucose molecules are joined together in one long line. Amylose is sleek and streamlined; the racing car of the starchy world. Amylopectin, however, isn’t so smooth. The glucose molecules attach to one another at different angles, producing shorter bulkier chains, with branches and bristles sticking out; more of a 4×4 than a racing vehicle. The most important thing about starch, though, is the way in which it reacts to heat. Starch from corn or wheat, or indeed any plant, is stored in the form of tiny solid granules, containing a mixture of amylose and amylopectin (the precise ratio depends on the plant). These granules are starch molecules packed together in a tight rigid structure. When mixed into cold water, the granules absorb a little bit of water, but not much; they are rigid, they don’t like outsiders, thank you very much. At this point, if you add too much water the granules simply clump together at the bottom of the pan, rejecting the water entirely. I think we’ve ALL been there. Lumpy gravy anyone? Gradually adding water distributes the granules throughout the liquid, but they’re still distinct granules just floating about in water, they don’t want to socialise, and they have no effect on the thickness of the liquid. When you add heat, though, you see changes. Gradually the water molecules gain energy from the heat; they start to jump around in excitement, leaping and bounding around the starch granules. Soon, this jumping and pouncing starts to affect the granules, the weaker sections start to break down, they want to play, and they start to think about interacting with all that energetic water. As soon as one region of the granule breaks down and interacts, this creates room for more water to be absorbed. The more water that the granule absorbs, the more strain it is under to give way and interact with the water. Starch molecules begin to leak out into the water, and flap around joyously. If they happen to bump into another starch molecule, they hold hands and skip together. More and more chains bump together, and hold hands; they start to form a meshy network of chains throughout the liquid, this is when your sauce starts to thicken.",2369

t3_nideaz,Is 'Hegemony and Socialist Strategy' by Ernesto Laclau und Chantal Mouffe a Lacanian text?,gz1iifh,"It is a work that very occasionally employs Lacanian concepts, but I think it would be a stretch to call it a 'Lacanian text' as such. Their concern is not with elaborating a Lacanian position on things (in their case, radical democracy and socialist strategy), but picking out a few choice Lacanian notions in service of their broader, post-Marxist project. The most prominent, explicitly mentioned Lacanian concept being that of the ""point de capiton"" or nodal point, which they use to try and explain how hegemony can be achieved without completely stifling the role of politics. This is not to say that the argument or the book cannot be translated into Lacanian terms - Zizek does exactly this, along with Laclau in particular - only that it's not exclusively Lacanian by any means. You might want to check out their back-and-forth exchange in their 'debate-book' with Judith Butler, *Contingency, Hegemony, Universality*, where the 'Lacanian' formulation of things becomes alot more explicit. That all said, the genealogy of the idea of the social field as structured around an 'antagonism' is kinda murky. Oliver Marchart's *Post Foundational Political Thought* traces the idea back to Heidegger, before refracting into more explicitly social and political works like those of Arendt, Schmitt, Ricoeur, and Lefort. Although honestly you can probably find it in Hegel and Marx too. All these currents were definitely in the air when Lacan was teaching, and they all definitely fed into L&amp;M, as well as Zizek's own conceptions on the matter. So it's kinda hard to establish priority here, although I think the *explicit* identification of the social field as antagonistic in Lacan's manner of speaking was indeed by L&amp;M. If you want to read a good Lacanian critique of Laclau's use of Lacanian concepts, Molly Anne Rothernberg's *The Excessive Subject* has a great chapter on him that basically charges him with not being Lacanian enough. Another place to look would be Stavrakakis' *Lacan and the Political* which also has some good stuff on this.",2061

I know Wittgenstein is deified by many, but I don't regret not spending more time on him in that course, as it pertains specifically to theories of reference. However, since Kripke is hugely influenced by Wittgenstein, it would behoove you to study him in depth to fully understand the intellectual history from Wittgenstein to casual reference. But for a simple survey course, I think it's more important to hit the major arguments and propositions that endured in the discourse, rather than indulging in Wittgenstein as much as would be necessary to really appreciate him.

t3_nm8byp,ELI5: How does inflation work?,gznftwd,"To understand how inflation works, let's first look at how money works. I have an apple here and I want to sell it for two Bazoogies (Bazoogies are the currency in my country and it's by no means any funnier than Dollar, so there!). You want an apple and you have two Bazoogies Now you would have to decide if that apple I have is worth two Bazoogies. You decide it's not, because the guy next to me is selling it for just one Bazoogy. That makes me sad. But now that my neighbor's apple is gone, the next guy wanting an apple would have to pay my price if he really wants it. Or he has to go without an apple. If nobody thinks an apple is worth two bazoogies, I'll eventually have to drop my prices. On the other hand, if people buy my apple for two Bazoogies, and I still have another apple, why not charge 4 for it? If people have enough money and want apples badly enough, they'll pay 4 Bazoogies, too. In comes the state. They print the money, and they can make as many Bazoogies as they want, at least in theory. The thing is, if they print a lot of Bazoogies, suddenly everyone has tons of Bazoogies, but I don't have tons of apples. I can sell my apples for 10, 100, 1000 Bazoogies, and there will still be people buying them. If there are more people who want to buy something, and have the Bazoogies to do so, than there are people who have products they want to sell, the price will go up. That's basically supply and demand. Money, like any commodity, has a supply. Yes, money is basically just another ""product"". Its value is basically determined by how rare it is. A lot of people think that more money in the economy means inflation. That is not necessarily true. As long as the supply of money is equal to its demand, the price of money will not change. Or, in other words, if there are enough goods to satisfy the additional money, prices will remain stable even if more money is available. That only works, though, as long as there are enough goods to go around. In other words, there are two reasons why inflation, and thus the devaluation of money, can happen. Either because money gets pumped into the system while the amount of available goods stagnates, which is what happened in Germany in the early 1920s. There is another reason, though, that is when there are not enough goods that people want to satisfy the existing money. This is something you can observe in various communist countries where the local currency is practically worthless, even though there isn't any printing going on. There just isn't enough goods to satisfy the existing money in circulation.",2590

t3_nofrdx,How to stop being obsessed by a girl?,h00ppg5,"TL;DR: She liked the attention you were giving her. She was stringing you along. I commend you for telling her how you were starting to develop stronger feelings, but she didn’t pull away fast enough and part of me thinks she didn’t because she truly enjoyed spending time with you because of how it made her feel. But then she realized that she could jeopardize her own relationship with her fiancé and then self-preservation kicked in and she pulled away. It sucks to feel used by people. You weren’t attached and she was. She told you that you were her ideal guy, and in turn you showed her more attention and developed stronger feelings. The fact of the matter is this: if you could find another girl who you were attracted to and to whom you also felt a connection, you would forget about this girl. Let her go, for your own sanity. The other fact is that you’ve realized that you have some obsessive qualities, but she definitely stoked the fire and brought those out of you with little regard to your feelings. There is a lesson to be learned here and it’s now your job to work on how quickly you get attached. You can’t control your romantic feelings, but you can avoid people and situations that will not be in your best interest (like spending time with an unavailable woman, or at least pulling yourself back once you realize that it’s heading in that direction).

Many abusers were abused themselves (and you’re right it doesn’t excuse your actions, but can provide some insight). Be self reflective about why you think you do specific behaviors and then when you’re ready, I think speaking to a therapist would help rewire your tendencies to healthier habits. Try not to berate yourself too much. If you’re in college, there should be resources for you on-campus.

A toxic chemical can become more toxic after its intended-purpose ""expiration"" date, but that's not more because the chemical loses effectiveness, not because it's a poison that became more poisonous. As a point of example, gas can go bad, but gas isn't designed to be a poison. I can't think of any examples of chemicals that get more toxic as they age, but I'm sure some exist. These are toxic, but aren't specifically branded as a poison. I would assume that any fabricated poison would either retain its level of toxocity indefinitely, or would degrade over time.

t3_n3i2xq,Is there any reason why Deontology and Virtue Ethics are incompatible?,gwq1gs6,"So, I think you misunderstand virtue ethics a little. A virtue is not an obligation or an act. Rather, virtue is a character trait. In virtue ethics, what you are striving for is not acting in an honest way, acting in a courageous way, etc. Rather, what is important to virtue ethics is **being** honest, **being** courageous, etc. If you have those as part of your character, then you will naturally act virtuously. You gain these virtues by fostering them, which is usually by understanding the virtues and practicing them through your actions. However, if it is for a personal philosophy, I do not see anything wrong in imposing on yourself a duty to act consistent with a virtuous manner. Though, a problem with virtue ethics is that many accounts fail to specify what acts are consistent with virtue and give the actor guidance such as ""act as a virtuous person would."" This can be subjective and leaves a lot of wiggle room to kind of lawyer yourself a loophole.

As others have said it has to do with the wear of the hoof. Some domestic horses don't need their hooves trimmed at all because they roam around fairly large areas and they wear down naturally, but typically they do need to get trimmed after a while. Softer the ground the more they'll need it. But they're living on sandy or rocky ground it wears down the hoof a lot more.

t3_n7b0jr,ELI5: why is partially hydrogenated oil deemed unsafe and banned by the FDA but regular hydrogenated oil is not?,gxbz37f,"Firstly its important to understand what saturated and unsaturated fats are. Fats in nature tend to be what we call triglycerides, this is a weird looking chemical, but essentially it consists of a thing called glycerol at the top, consisting of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon with three ""legs"" that consist of just carbon and hydrogen. Google an image of a triglyceride find out what I mean. You notice that this will consist of a carbon backbone with a bunch of hydrogen surrounding this carbon. Now these are pretty good at storing energy, turns out things that have a bunch of carbon and hydrogen in them but little oxygen tend to burn pretty well. Sugars have a higher proportion of oxygen in them which makes them less desirable as energy storage but are still used because they are smaller than lipids and thus easier to break down. Saturation refers to the question of how full these legs are of hydrogen molecules. Fully saturated triglycerides have these legs completely full of hydrogen, to the point where all bonds in the carbon backbone are either single bonds to other carbon atoms or bonds to hydrogen atoms on the sides. The symmetry here tends to make these legs nice and straight, these have very nice properties such as being solid at room temperature because their legs are nice and straight and not bent, they tend to settle into a solid pretty easily (imagine a bunch of toothpicks stacked perpendicularly, that's why butter is solid). Then there are unsaturated fats. They lack two or more hydrogen molecules in their legs, and instead those carbon atoms lacking a hydrogen make a double bond with their neighboring carbon molecule. Usually these double bonds make the leg ""kink"" and bend to one side (google saturated vs unsaturated fats for images). This is why say vegetable oils are liquid, these kinks prevent it from forming a nice dense solid at room temperature and instead keep the oil as a viscous liquid, as the kinks cause the fat molecules to tangle but not arrange nicely and close enough to solidify. Which brings us to the question of what is hydrogenation and why is it done. Fats in vegetables tend to be unsaturated, while fats in animals tend to be saturated. The traditional reason for this is because saturated fats hold more energy and this is useful for animals because this means less weight that they have to carry to get some amount of energy, while plants just don't care how heavy they become, they are grounded anyways and don't have a heating system to melt the saturated fats so that they can go where they are needed. But vegetables tend to be easier to raise than animals, including their fats. People use both saturated and unsaturated fats in cooking for their respective reasons, sometimes its useful to have a solid fat at room temperature. Point is people wanted to turn vegetable oils into a solid product, and for that we have to figure out how to saturate vegetable's unsaturated fats. Some smart people came up with the idea of hydrogenation, the idea is that under immense pressure we can force additional hydrogen atoms into unsaturated fats and saturate them further. What they found is that the process of hydrogenation sometimes makes fats that are known as trans fats. Normal unsaturated fats have this ""kink"" that I mention because in nature most plants make fats that are known as ""cis unsaturated fats"" meaning that the two hydrogens that are missing for unsaturated fat is found on the same side of the leg, which causes the leg to bend in that direction, nature is pretty good at crafting atoms together in a specific way and plants almost always produce cis fats. But trans fats occur when these missing hydrogen spots are found on the opposite sides of the legs, you can think of it that one missing hydrogen kinks the leg and the other kinks it in the other way because its on the opposite side, causing the legs to be straight. For a while this wasn't considered a problem, in fact this was considered good because trans fats, like fully saturated fats, tended to solidify well because the leg of the fat was not kinked, and it was cheaper for manufacturers in terms of the amount of hydrogen they had to put in and the amount of time spent saturating. This leg to them partially hydrogenating the fats rather than fully hydrogenating. And hell it was even better, because saturated fats have more calories in them than unsaturated. They could get the benefits of saturated fat's solidification without its calorie cost. But for whatever reason, trans have a pesky habit of getting stuck in your arteries, increasing the risk of heart attacks. Fully saturated fats have this too but for whatever reason trans fats tend to do this even more. So the solution has been to ban partial hydrogenation and move to full hydrogenation, eliminating trans fats.",4830

Also, consider how many people of age you see and how many of them just don’t have combat potential and go into other areas like researchers, librarians, groundskeepers.

If a certain wrestler ends up being way more popular than expected, they may change plans to let that wrestler have a more prominent place in the current storylines. If a wrestler sells a lot of merchandise, the company may decide to give them a ""push"" and make them more prominent, but also a wrestler who gets more screen time will likely sell more merchandise and get more fans, so they can try and influence things the other way around too. It helps to think of it less as a fake sport, and more of a soap opera about athletes. There's good guys and bad guys, and rivalries and friendships. Pro wrestling shows might book a mean evil guy to be the champion, to set up a storyline where a good guy works hard and has to overcome terrible odds to defeat the villain and become the new champion. And then, yet another story will unfold about what happens next.",985

t3_n9vmmx,"ELI5: Why, when pouring water, does it sometimes run down the edge on the surface rather than into a container?",gxq77uc,"As 1LuckFogic said, water tends to stick to some materials (wetting them) like glass or common plastics while it ""pearls off"" others, e. g. good raingear or the waxy surface of some [pitcher plants](https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/pitcher-plant-inspires-ultimate-non-stick-surface/3003195.article). A well-designed water pitcher or teapot should have a strongly curved lip at the end of the spout so that the water (or tea) can unstick itself from the container – it would have to flow upwards to remain in contact with the surface. Laboratories also use beakers made of non-stick plastics similar to the ones coating non-stick frying pans. I've also read that the [Coanda effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coand%C4%83_effect) could be involved: flowing fluid tends to cling to nearby convex surfaces as does the air at the top of an airplane's wing.

t3_n9vlxz,"ELI5: How multifuel engines works ? (Thinking of Military engine who can take gasoline, jet fuel, fuel oil, etc ...) Is it all combined or different tank ?",gxpziy3,"This is one of the coolest patents I have read. The multifuel engine is based on a diesel engine. The problem with using lighter oils like gasoline and ethanol in a diesel engine is that it will detonate too soon, before the piston is at the top. There are a few changes they have done to prevent this. Firstly there is a mechanism to adjust the injection timing depending on the fuel. This was quite revolutionary at the time using mechanical systems but is now pretty much standard on all engines. But they also use a bit different injectors which does not spray the fuel in such a fine mist but instead coats the hot piston in a film of fuel to evaporate. This makes the injection timings much more similar between different fuels. Another issue is that diesel is its own lubricant so injectors and the fuel pump is actually lubricated by the fuel. So they had to change these to be lubricated by engine oil. The disadvantage to all these changes is that even though the engine can run on all fuels it will run quite badly on every fuel. Fuel consumption is high, it is underpowered for its size and it burns though lots of engine oil. They do run better on diesel then other fuels so this is usually what they use. However the concept is that in an emergency situation where diesel is unavailable they can use other sources of fuel and just mix it into the fuel tank. Especially if the engine is already warm it should be able to run on almost anything. Military vehicles do often have multiple fuel tanks they can switch between and it is a good practice to keep some ""good"" fuel in a seperate tank to make sure the engine is able to start and warm up before switching to the fuel tank with the dirty fuel.",1711

The computer needs to find the information again later. So the computer has a ""notebook"" at the start of the drive, called the index. In the index, it writes down what information it has, and where it wrote that information down. Now let's say you delete the picture. It would be wasteful to erase all the data. So instead, the computer erases it's entry in the index, so that it knows the spot is available to write something over that data if it needs the space later.

But in real cases most of the stuff you can find, things you can observe and words people say to you actually lead to nowhere and don't help you to deduct anything, so *real detectives* mostly just cover the city they operate in with a total surveillance, beat everyone they profiled until confession, and optionally construct parallel evidence, and that is what Batman is so good at.",874

She grew up as an older sister in a rural family, and my grandparents invested a lot of money into my uncle, while she had to make her own way. Eventually she got a good job - and she was good at it too - and she'd spend some money from each paycheck to get some new things for herself. She also got abandoned by my brother's father, which may have contributed to the development of hoarding behavior; definitely made spending money on herself harder as she had to take care of her son all on her own. She'd go on to meet my dad and eventually they had me. In a way growing up around her tendencies to ""keep and save things"" made me more callous towards organizing and tidying in general.

If we assume that only a quarter of days are sunny that's 1.095 ~~petajoules~~ terajoules per year, since solar panels don't work well at night. So if you actually built enough lightning collectors to catch all of the lightning you'd still get about 20x as much energy from the solar panels.

I guess my bestie heard about it, as we were friends with that guy's brother. His response was phenomenal. He stopped speaking to me, period (even years later when I ran into him and addressed him excitedly, he ignored me and kept walking). Our last year was coming to a close around that time, so he got himself into the position of editing our year's farewell yearbook, which was designed to be a memento of all our special memories, and writing the blurbs that went along with everyone's photo. He had no interest in the yearbook and got into this position purely for his emotional ""revenge"" for this thing I did which had nothing to do with him. His contribution to my photo was under Most Memorable Accomplishment, where he wrote: *The entire squadron of the HMAS Canberra* At first I laughed, because I was confused and naive, and it hurt me in a way I couldn't explain. In retrospect of him ending our friendship without a word of explanation, destroying my year book and attempting to shame me to our entire year at school, it was a grossly cruel, unfair, and spiteful way to treat someone he supposedly cared for.

Even if an organism has a trait that is seemingly obsolete, then at the very least, that trait was once useful and is now just a residual characteristic. A more direct answer to your question: You may also take note that lions are the only felid that lives in groups, so the distinct mane of a male lion likely has more to do with their communal behavior (you can Google that, there’s quite a few theories)",895

t3_ngk9y8,Eli5: why does milk help when you eat something spicy?,gyrgtgi,"The molecule that's causing the spiciness is called *capsaicin*. Capsaicin triggers nerves that sense heat, causing them to fire even though the food isn't hot (or at least, not as hot as your nerves *think* it is). As long as the capsaicin is on your tongue, it will continue working its way to your nerves and turning them on, keeping that burning sensation going. Capsaicin is **not** water soluble, meaning it doesn't dissolve in water. Capsaicin is [hydrophobic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3jA40arq9Y), like oil and fat. So, trying to wash the capsaicin away with water does very little: it sticks to the fats in your tongue and around your nerves *way* more than it sticks to water, so the water can't carry it off of your tongue. Without getting to why, things that are water soluble tend not to dissolve in oil, and vice versa. That means that capcaisin *is* pretty soluble in fat and oil. Milk is *full* of fats. Those fats aren't *dissolved* in the water, they're just broken up into such tiny particles that are all mixed together and suspended in the water. Capsaicin, being soluble in fat, will stick to those tiny particles of milk fat and subsequently get carried away by the milk. With the capsaicin removed from your tongue, the nerves start to calm down and stop firing as much. It helps that milk is generally *cold* which your brain thinks is soothing on what your brain thinks is a bad burn. Cold water doesn't help because, as stated before, it doesn't also remove the ""burning.""",1507

This coincides with a move to *nix, then OS X. I’ve been noodling around with computers since I was a kid in the late 80s and early 90s. Built my first windows PC as an undergrad in the late 90s (UK, STEM) - would have been windows 98. We had a computer lab where we accessed email via pine - I checked it, oh, once a week? My box did not have an internet connection at first. About this time, I was introduced to Linux by some engineering friends, and BSD in the lab I was working in, where we were doing computational molecular modeling. When I hit grad school in 2001, I bought the first in a series of Dell laptops. My project evolved from experimental to computational, so I switched to Linux full time - first Debian, then Ubuntu around 2004? By this time I was pretty glued to a wired internet connection at work and had DSL service at home. I started using cluster computing, and my tools were perl, zsh, and R. Postdoc starting in 2006 - more cluster computing, built an Ubuntu box under my desk for some local heavy lifting, and a Lenovo thinkpad running ubuntu for everything else. Then around 2008 I got my first metal-body MacBook - I was tired of doing all the sysadmin for my boxes, and I wanted a plug and play solution that would also give me shells and native nix-like tools. Mac OS X seemed to fit the bill. Today, I still use a MacBook, though my work has shifted to mostly word processing I still write some code. I wrote some wdl stuff for a cluster run today, as a matter of fact. We are shifting over to cloud-based compute, but many of my old tools are still mainstays of my work: awk one liners, zsh, R, emacs and the rest. Plus ça change...",1804

t3_nj7jnj,Is searching for meaning a narcissistic act?,gz6m9hx,"I'm not totally sure what version of narcissism you're using. Narcissism is usually psychological or clinical. The psychoanalytic theories can be different still from the more colloquial diagnostic reference to grandiosity, selfishness, exploitativeness, etc. You're right that the pursuit of meaning has sometimes been anthropocentric though and perhaps even narcissistic in the Western tradition. Descartes rooted the locus of knowledge in the thinking self, and so a lot of philosophy went down a path-dependent trajectory toward thinking in terms of selves. But I would argue the pursuit of meaning is anti-narcissistic. Narcissism tends to involve an orientation of devaluing others in favor of an overvalued self. When we struggle with the question of meaning -- is there meaning in existence, where, why -- we have to think rationally beyond our own drives, wants, needs, impulses, etc. If we reject the possibility of some kind of real meaning in the world, we have little left but the satisfaction of our own drives and desires. So to the extent that meaning forces a (collective) consideration of something real or even consistently valuable beyond the self and its subjective wants, it seems that meaning is actually the way out of narcissism. Your other point was that it supports our delusions of being important or having significance. Well, the problem with foreclosing on meaning and saying humans lack significance -- or the world lacks significance -- seems also to lead us toward a position where we can devalue things. There are problems with overvaluing our position in the cosmos but there seem to be equally significant problems with treating it as value-less. So again, without a further argument, I see issues in both directions and struggle to conclude how pursuing a theory of meaning is any less prone to justifying narcissism than is pursuing a theory of nihilism.",1893

t3_njo4rv,What product should people be warned to never buy?,gz8xs6b,"RAYCON EARBUDS. Please do not give these people your money. I have been kicking myself every day since I bought these pieces of shit. So many YouTubers I follow have recommended them over the years and I was looking for a reliable but inexpensive pair of truly wireless ear buds, so I decided to treat myself, especially since they were having a pretty decent sale. They have never worked as intended. The first bad sign was that there were typos in the instructions. The second bad sign was that both ear buds popped up in my Bluetooth as ""Raycon E55 Earbud"" with neither one indicating if it was the left or right side. Initially, I was only ever able to connect the right. I tried connecting the left, but it would never pair. There were no instructions for pairing them beyond turning them on and connecting them to the bluetooth. Eventually I had to turn on ""dual audio"" on my phone so each ear bud could connect individually. This seemed like a decent solution until I realized how easily they come outta sync with each other, so I'd have the same song playing at different spots in my ears. Additionally, both ear buds would act as if they're the right one; you're supposed to be able to double or triple tap the right one and it skips to the next song, and the left one will go back a song, but both skip to the next song no matter which one you use. The company also only links you to some ""factory reset"" option when you email them which straight up doesn't work as they describe it and I'm not confident these specific ones can even be factory reset. They then also say that if that doesn't work to return them; they don't even try to help beyond that because they clearly don't know how their cheap ass product works. I'm convinced the positive reviews were paid for. Their return policy if you're not from the US is super dumb. They only refund your PayPal account and you have to send them ALL this proof that you sent it back. In the end, I'm not able to send mine back because the tiny charging cable somehow completely disappeared despite only ever using it once (pretty sure my roommate took it and misplaced it but he has no idea). Anyway, don't make my mistake. You can get even cheaper, more reliable truly wireless ear buds and not hate yourself like me.",2276

t3_nmxoco,ELI5: I’ve always heard people in the US have iPhones on a “contract” and end up getting the latest phone as and when the contract ends. How does this system work?,gzrelqb,"That common system has changed in recent years... it used to be that you'd pay only a fraction of the true cost up front, and the 2-years contract for service would include the rest of the phone's cost baked in. Now, you can finance a phone through a carrier or Apple, still typically over 2 years, but it's separate from your service (which no longer carries a contract). So 7-8 years ago, you'd pay $200 to get a $800 iPhone, with AT&amp;T charging you $80/mo for service with a 2 year contract -- of which $25/mo went toward the phone's full cost, but wasn't a separate line item. Now, you might get a phone through them, but the $65/mo call/data plan is separate from the $40/mo phone financing.

Neither of us thought much of it. He had always wanted kids when he was younger but his most recent long term partner was against them. In that situation, he conceded and got used to the idea of never having kids. That opinion was quite strong when we met. I never tried to convince him to change his mind, and didn't really bring the topic up, but as our relationship progressed and he thought more about his options, he found himself wanting a family. This did not happen overnight. We must have been together 2 years before he tentatively started bringing the subject up as a possibility for us. We've been together 5 years, no kids yet, but he's almost more excited than I am now. I think it's very important to find out someones reasons for their choices, so you can better understand them.

The pheromone will then attract the queen bee herself, which she then will command the worker bees to carry her to the bear to then proceed to mate. The end result being a a little beear cub, after you have a few beear cubs, they mate and youre swimming in the honey! Another note: Artificial insemination wont work due to the queen bee unable to survive the birth, leading to stillborn.

You can't beat the odds and become a successful author or creative writer if you don't put your work out there and try. Another thing to consider, is that there are Authors and creative writers out there that are making ends meet, despite not being a household name. Just like any other job in the world, there are Levels of success. There is no ""Make it or fail"" in writing. Similarly, there are a select few individuals out there that have earned the horrible ire of critics and readers.

It works reasonably well short-term, but if you can't deliver on the promised payoff, you'll lose a lot of people once that happens. Put too much focus on a character's deep dark secret, and then have it turn out to be that they dye their hair and it isn't naturally blonde will be disappointing at best.

I stopped looking and focused on building my future and being the person I want to be, and met someone doing the same, and have been together since. We were mid-late twenties by then. In high school and college, it's hard to discern long term goals of everyone around you because not only are you all sharing a temporary goal, but still figuring out the details of the longer term ones. Those details matter a great deal. So if you do get together and spend a bunch of time during school, you can get out and find out you two have nothing in common now! After the hustle of schooling, you get into a new zone where you come into your own. As are others. So when you are doing what you want to do and meeting people doing the same, you end up meeting people that are likely highly compatible for the long term. So by all means have fun.

When I was in 9th grade I made something with my knee so every step hurted. Took me more than 3 years to convince my mother I needed help. An MRI later the problem was found and treated away within a month. My one knee was visible different from the other one. Yes, knees ain't pretty, but they should look the same. It's still a standing joke my parents bring up. ""Do you remember that time OP wanted to try climbing?"" They just laugh and laugh. It really Hurts. This make it hard for me to train in public.

Really hard to bike then. The lump of fat you have in your knee, mine was too big for fit do it got in between the bones and got stuck.

t3_nfpgct,"Why cheat on your spouses, why not just leave?",gyn7cvp,"Imma start by saying this is my opinion: I might be ""too young"" to respond to this, but I don't think cheating is a matter of falling out of love with the one you're with. It's just something different. Something random. I would make a food analogy but it might not fit. Sex is just sex. We're humans. We're mammals and it's done on impulse. Yeah, going behind your partners back to fuck someone is some fucked up shit. But it's only wrong because your partner didn't know. Being committed to someone and wanting to have sex with someone else just 1 time else doesn't seem problematic to me. Now if it's cheating as in emotional relationships outside of your committed one, then THAT can be a major issue.

Just like every other boyband over the past few decades (The Beatles, Backstreet Boys, One Direction), people, especially teenage girls, will go crazy for hot men. * Kpop groups in general provide a lot of more content for their fans when compared to Western artists. Hence, a lot of people tend to be captured by their personalities and the way they work well as a group. * They trained for years and have really good talent. Their three rappers are some of the best in Kpop, and they have great vocalists. Very good dancers as well. Plus, a lot of their songs are written by the members themselves, which is something their fans (Army's) appreciate. * They have some really good music. A lot of people my age are into it.

Using those will require very specific knowledge. For example if you were to build a shield out of adamantium then it will be really bad because atleast a steel shield can get dented and absorbing some impact while it will get passed completely to the person holding it. Vibranium is very good for a lot of thing but you can't just use it to build regular things because it will not work out well. To use these metals you need to study their property (and probably need to touch/study the metal before you can create it). You can easily find info about other metals easily but these are not easy to find and it is very hard to figure out what kind of things can be built using them without having a large quantity to use.,812

t3_nhtfww,"ELI5 what is the difference between LED, LCD, OLED, QLED, and plasma?",gyyaq58,"A lot of it is deliberately misleading branding from manufacturers, there are really only 2 main TV technologies right now (LCD &amp; OLED) * **LCD: Liquid crystal display**. The same technology used for the display in digital watches and alarm clocks, but miniaturised to the point where they can make up the pixels of a screen. The pixels don't produce their own light so they need a backlight. Old LCDs used CCFL backlights (flat fluorescent lamps) but since about 2010 they have used LED backlights. To market the newer backlight technology manufacturers commonly call these ""**LED TV**s"", even though they are just LCDs with a better backlight. **QLED** is Samsung branding for LCD TVs that have 'quantum dot' films inside them, it's a layer between the backlight and LCD layer that enables the tv to produce more colours with higher brightness. A problem with LCD is that when watching dark scenes some of the light from the backlight still bleeds through, making blacks look grey (especially at high brightness settings). Local dimming is a technology where the backlight is divided into sections that can individually be made lighter or darker, allowing an LCD screen to look better in dark scenes, **Mini LED** is the term for a perfect version of this local dimming technology where every pixel has it's own individual backlight, this is the newest LCD technology branding you will start seeing in 2021 TVs, but it's still LCD at it's core. * **OLED: Organic Light Emitting Diodes**. This is a totally different technology to LCD, the pixels themselves produce their own light so there's no backlight. This means there's no backlight bleeding through during dark scenes allowing inky blacks and amazing contrast. Also because there's no extra layers needed for the backlight, quantum dot layer, etc OLED TVs can be extremely thin. The downsides of OLED is that the pixels break down over time and static images can get burned in, also they tend not to be as bright as LCD screens. That said companies have been improving the technology every year making these problems less and less prevalent. * **Plasma** screens were an older technology which worked by having thousands of pockets of a gas that would turn into plasma and produce light when an electric field was put across them. It offered many of the same benefits as OLED since each pixel made it's own light, but it was costly to manufacture compared to LCD TVs, and then OLED came along offering all of the same picture quality benefits and made it truly obsolete. There is a new upcoming TV technology called 'Micro LED', which is a TV made up of millions of tiny LED lights. It has the same benefits as OLED but with the increased brightness and longevity of LCD TVs, so it's like a best of both.",2766

The part is split into layers, and the glue stick draws the outline of the layer, and then colours in the middle. It the moves up one layer and does it again until all the layers have been drawn. SLA uses a bath of liquid, which turns solid if you shine a bright light at it. So it uses a laser to draw on the liquid turning it solid layer by layer, much like the FDM a process drawing the outline and then colouring in the middle. The liquid is in a transparent tray and the laser shines up from below. There is a platform in the liquid which leaves a thin gap one layer in height to which the solidified liquid sticks. Once each layer is complete this platform moves up by one layer, leaving a thin layer of liquid under the solidified part, stuck to the platform and it all starts again.",1042

Think of it this way, if you needed to know more about economics than the layperson before you even set foot in a college classroom, what would the point of college even be? No matter what college you end up in, you'll most likely still have to take an introductory economics course, and you'll learn what you need to learn there. It's great that you want to learn and are interested in diving into the topic, but don't stress about learning the material - focus on *exploring* it. What are the different areas and specialties of economics that really excite you and why? What sort of careers seem intriguing? Are there economists or professors that really inspire you? Besides reading books, you can also subscribe to financial news magazines and papers, listen to podcasts about economics, and follow economists on social media.

Once the silver was in place they would then lay down coatings of nickel and/or copper on the back side of the silver usually either chemically or via electroplating. Once the backing was thick and stiff enough they could etch away the silver leaving the (positive) metal master in a harder, more durable metal like nickel, or copper, or an alloy of the two. From that positive metal master they would make negative stamping plates. To make the stamping plates they would apply a chemical to the top of the metal master that acts as a sort of lubricant to make it easier to separate the new copy from the metal master. Think putting butter on a waffle iron. Then they would electroplate on top of that chemical layer with nickel. Once the electroplating is thick enough they separate the new electroplate negative from the metal master. Then they electroplate the top of the stamping negative with chromium to make it more scratch resistant. Then they pop it on the press and start stamping vinyl.",1209

After an hour of no customers and me watching the football on my phone the first people find the place and walk in. I greet my new guests and one woman asks me ""wheres the bartender"" despite me being dressed just like the bartenders downstairs. After explaining that I was the bartender she replies ""no way are you old enough to be working in a place like this"" and goes downstairs to tell one of the bouncers that an underage boy has snuck in and is posing as the bartender in the Gin Room (that's what my little bar was called) she comes up with one of the bouncers and to his bemusement realises that they're talking about me. He swiftly replies ""he IS the bartender - he runs this bar, so don't worry, he'll look after you. But if you waste my time again I'll have to ask you to leave."" At this point her friends (who believed me from the start) are absolutely howling with laughter and despite my best attempts to remain professional I let out a little satisfied smirk.

t3_nmatb8,"eli5 Why sleeping just 30 minutes less during night, horribly affects my cognitive function and performance?",gzngm64,"Probably because you're interrupting a sleep cycle. During an average night, you will go through two sleep cycles. Your brain will go into REM sleep, then fall into deeper sleep, bounce around for about 90 minutes at the lowest levels of sleep, then come back up for REM sleep and do it all over again. A whole sleep cycle takes about 3-4 hours depending on the person. If you wake during REM sleep, you will probably feel refreshed. Wake during one of the deep sleep phases, though, and you're pretty fucked up. It's a terrible analogy, but it's sorta like you tried to go into fourth gear from a standing stop if you wake from deep sleep, rather than going smoothly from third to fourth when waking from REM.

So just pick a dosage that will work for the vast majority of body masses that is also safe to take. Its safe and does the job so theres no need to look into catering dosage management for wildly different bodies. For more serious medications with serious risks (aka prescribed medication) - dosage does matter purely to reduce side effects and to be effective for what ever ailment the person has. This is one reason why some meds are over the counter - their high safety tolerances for the dosage offered and tends to work for most people. So no need to have multiple dosage options.",795
t3_npfan5,ELI5: how do loud noises cause problems to your hearing and eventually make you deaf?,h04v9rp,"Inside your ear^1 are tiny hairs that act like microphones tuned^2 to the different frequencies^3 we can hear. Vibrations are carried along the auditory nerve to the brain. These hairs are formed when you are in the womb and do not grow back when damaged^4 . Loud and sustained^5 noise in particular can damage these hairs. Any kind of trauma or internal damage to the inner ear may also cause permanent hearing loss, for example loud impulses (gunshots, explosions) which will tear the ear drum and it may not heal perfectly, penetrating the ear drum (for example with a q-tip) can cause the same. In addition, chronic ear infections are associated with hearing loss. There are more mysterious forms of auditory damage like tinnitus, or ringing in the ears. It is correlated with trauma and exposure to loud noises but we don't have a good understanding of the mechanism by which we perceive it. 1. The hairs are inside your cochlea, a bony snail shaped structure that is connected via the bones of the inner ear to your ear drum. Inside the cochlea is a sac of liquid called the basilar membrane, the hairs live along this membrane. There is a complex electromechanical relationship involved that converts pressure waves into mechanical vibration and finally into electrical pulses along the nerve. 2. Higher frequencies require smaller hairs. These are more fragile, which is why we lose high frequencies as we age. 3. They're actually tuned to a range of frequencies and they overlap. This is why low frequency noise ""masks"" higher frequency noise. 4. They grow back in some animals, like turtles. 5. Like a rock concert, plane flight, or noisy restaurant. So tl;dr there are hairs in your ear that don't grow back, and bones and stuff that can break and won't heal right. Don't stick stuff in there and wear ear protection.",1828

t3_n3u5tw,ELI5: How does email work and why does it limit the file sizes we can send with it?,gwruvo1,"The email protocol does not limit the file sizes that can be sent.

They impose these limits to protect themselves from accidental or malicious abuse. Otherwise it would be trivially easy for any outsider to clog up your entire mailbox (or even the entire server) just by sending huge mail which ""eat up"" all available storage. On a very basic level, the mail protocol works like this: * You create a message with a recipient address * You hand over the message to your local post office (your own mail server) * The postal service forwards the mail to the recipients post office (their mail server) * Their post office stores the message in the recipients post box (inbox) * The recipient eventually collects the mail from their post box There's no guaranteed delivery in this.

t3_n46bag,"Is it weird if your mc has a name, that some actual person also has?",gwumbf8,"Someone has, or has had every name ever. You think Harry Potter was a unique name when the book was written? There was a class-action lawsuit after the movies made the name hype famous because normal dudes named Harry Potter could get through a day of their lives without people casting spells at them. They lost the lawsuit. Because you can't copywrite a name. No one owns it. You have to get stupidly creative to invent a name that doesn't exist. And short of creating entire languages for those names to be based off of, it doesn't make much sense to do. Plus, I find (outside of the latter context, Tolkien gets a pass) bizarrely unique names placed in the normal world indicate to me that the author didn't actually have an interesting character in the first place. Harry Potter was an interesting characters. (he had an uninteresting name on purpose) but he didn't need a crazy name to be 'interesting'. In fact, only the bad-guy families had interesting names.

Depending on your personality you may strike up friendships and start to build relationships that could be very useful in your writing career. Even just being around other creative people can be very energising. You may also learn useful things from the presenters. A short story magazine editor did a Q&amp;A session at a convention I was at some years ago. I asked him what the best piece of advice he would give to any writer hoping to submit to his magazine was. He said ""Delete the first line of your story."" And went on to explain how a lot of writers try to use the first line as an introduction to the story, when it's really not needed and they should just let the story start without an introduction. When I got home I looked at the story I was working on and saw he was absolutely correct.

t3_n96rtx,ELI5: Why do adults suffer from diabetes and other conditions more than children?,gxma2rc,"There are two types of diabetes, aptly name Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 is an autoimmune disorder, meaning that the body mistakenly recognizes the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas as foreign invaders and destroys them. This is why all Type 1 diabetics need to take insulin: they can't produce their own. Type 2 diabetes is different in its mechanism in that you still have the ability to produce your own insulin (for the most part). However, your body either doesn't produce enough insulin, or your body becomes desensitized to the effects of insulin (also known as ""insulin resistance""). This occurs when there is always so much glucose (sugar) in the blood, that your body keeps trying to contain it by releasing insulin. However, the cells where the insulin does its work eventually stop paying attention to the insulin. It's kind of like the boy who cried wolf. The insulin keeps saying there is too much sugar in the body, but the cells say ""well, we can't have too much sugar ALL OF THE TIME, right? Insulin is exaggerating."" So they stop listening, and don't take up the amount of sugar needed to keep the blood sugar level in the healthy range. This whole process takes a long time, so children usually won't have type 2 diabetes. It takes many years of poor diet and exercise habits before one will develop type 2 diabetes.",1343

When I hear that a book is 100k words and beyond, it piques my interest. When I hear that a book series has a lot of installments it gets me excited to really immerse myself in a world with characters who will be around for a long time. I read in short bursts no matter how long the work is, and I get attached to characters, so this kind of reading works for me. Speaking of immersion, I love it when the author puts a lot of time and effort into creating immersive settings.

They take up to a decade to become established (and you have to grow the trees too). this obviously requires a rather large space and oak trees need temperature variation anyway so being in a greenhouse wouldn't really help in the first place. Truffles can be cultivated, and are cultivated, but they are cultivated in forests not greenhouses. Ramps (and wild ginseng) are slow growing specialists in forest understories. The bulb/root takes several years to mature and (in ginseng anyway) is considered more flavorful/powerful because it has matured slowly in the relatively harsh conditions of the wild. You could raise these in greenhouses but....first of all, like oak trees (and many other fruit trees and berry bushes) they are adapted to seasonal climates and need to be cold in the winter to mature properly. The whole point of a greenhouse is to keep things from getting cold, so there's not much point. You can grow them in a suitable patch of forest after sowing them there, but you have to wait for them to grow to maturity which takes up to a decade.

It really is the most calm, idyllic place. It's stuffed full of beautifully interesting antiques shops, little ice cream shops and locally owned businesses. Barely a single chain cornershop in sight. The locals tend to congregate there in the summer, but over the years I've visited i don't think I've ever seen an (obvious) foreign tourist. If you ever get the chance to visit my beautiful country, i really do suggest you grit your teeth and bare the 4 hour train ride from London. Book a little Airbnb and stay in the area a few nights.

t3_nm1dt0,"ELI5: what's RAM, and how much do I need?",gzlzbsx,"When we're thinking we need to use our short term memory to hold our thoughts. RAM is kind of like the short term memory for the computer. Your computer needs enough RAM to 'remember' everything it is doing (programs/games), or else it will have to use other storage to keep track of what it is doing. RAM is super fast compared to any other storage you have on your computer. Compare it to instantly being able to remember something (RAM) v.s. having to look for a thought in a large book ('other storage when you don't have enough RAM). It is very noticeable when your computer doesn't have enough of it and must use the slower stuff. As for how much you need, 16 GB (2 x 8GB sticks) will probably suffice for your needs.

t3_n56sx2,ELI5: Exactly how do genes mutate?,gwzps2k,"There are different reasons for genes to mutate. Three of the most common ways are 1. Your DNA is kinda like a rope ladder with instructions for different things on each step. Radiation act as a cannon ball and come blast away a part of that ladder. Now when your cell tries to read that to do its function, it screws up and you end up with cancers. 2. Your cells are constantly dividing. One of the part that needs to divide is the DNA, so both cells can have the same copy. How that happens is that both the DNA strands are pulled apart, and then the 2 halves are made into 2 whole by adding material to the 2 strands/halves. During this process, it's possible a wrong part is added in the wrong place. And that is another mutation. 3. Third is that when your reproductive cells divide, they also mix and match a few things. This is why you don't have exactly one parent's pure trait or the other, but can have a mix of things. Sometimes, these mix and match can happen with an error. So a part which wasn't intended to be cut, gets cut off, or is matched with a part not matched with before. And you get mutations we see in children where they have something their parent doesn't.",1183
t3_n5d7w5,What should be one's response to a friend who is grieving/crying? What choice of words help for real?,gx0ibg4,"I’ve found that offering something specific can be a lot more helpful than just saying to let you know if they need anything. It’s hard to think when you’re deep in despair. It’s easier if someone says, “How about I bring/make you some (favorite food) &amp; you can talk about it or we can just watch TV or whatever you like?” Or “Would it help if I came over &amp; did (specific chore) for you?” Or if they don’t want company just drop off some easy food that doesn’t have to be prepared like fruit &amp; microwaveable things. Grief takes all of your energy &amp; often eating is the first thing you give up on, but hunger &amp; dehydration make everything worse. Make sure they know you don’t care if they look “presentable” or not, you care about them &amp; you want to be there for them. Don’t try to rush their grief or speed up the healing. It takes as long as it takes &amp; it’s often much longer than people realize. If nothing else, the phrase, “I hate that you’re going through this &amp; I’m here to listen or just be around whenever you need.” Can make a big difference.",1083

Especially non-binary and trans relationships because often the LGBTQ+ community has had to spend more time thinking about gender and relationships. Like this one: [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2018.1531281](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2018.1531281) [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0891243217723883](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0891243217723883),962

t3_ne0jij,How do I maintain good eating habits while living with mom?,gyey0tz,"You gotta learn to do what's right. Your mom probably buys this stuff because she wants to make you happy with it. But if you actually want to avoid it, then it obviously achieve the opposite effect. Or at least it might do so later, after the dopamine rush from the sweets has faded and you realize what you've done again. You're probably enjoying the sweets though when you're eating them, aren't you? And that's why your mom keeps buying them for you. Have you actually tried to tell her to not do this anymore? Or do you not talk about such things? If she ignores it and is actively sabotaging you in such a way, then that's kind of a problem. Though in that case you'd just have to come to terms with the fact that other people don't always have the best intentions for you. And then do what you have to. Which means avoid any unhealthy foods she buys completely, same as her attempts at getting you to eat them. But if she does care about you and is not one of those people who is always trying to force their way on others, then she'd stop offering them to you and help you out instead. That's why you always talk to the person first to at least figure out if they're a rational person that wants to help you or someone who is looking to sabotage you.",1258

It should be no different for driving instructors. Learning to drive is stressful and overwhelming - you are in control of a frighteningly huge piece of machinery! - your instructor should be working hard to help you feel focused and at ease, not be making shitty comments for their own entertainment. Now, my driving instructor was super sarcastic and jokingly mean, but it was pretty obvious from my responses that I enjoyed that dynamic, and I never had any problem getting him to snap out of it when it wasn’t helpful. We joked around, he made fun of me, I made fun of him, we had a laugh, and then I might say something like “ok, but I’m going to crash your car if you don’t tell me what to do in plain words with no snark”, and he’d be professional.

Bike was fucked and luckily I didn't break anything, but when she hit me my left leg was lifted up and took the brunt of the impact.

Some people got out of their cars and helped carry me to a rec center that was a couple of blocks away. The center had trainers and some licensed physicians on staff and when they tried to release the muscles in my leg.

When they tried to to massage my leg out I felt nothing but electric shocks going from my thigh to my spine. Finally my leg loosened up and I could finally move my left leg.

t3_n3vy6t,"ELI5: Why is the loudest sound ever reported is considered to be the Krakatoa volcanic eruption, at 180 dB and could be directly heard 5,000km away but rocket launches regularly hits 200+ dB but are only heard within the vicinity of the ignition?",gws5hwm,"It does not make sense to measure sound like this. That is why you get these strange numbers. The atmosphere is not able to support sounds of over about 180 dB because at that point you start creating complete vacuum. This is why lound noises like rocket launches sounds like they are recorded on a broken microphone, it is not the microphone that is broken but the air itself. So these numbers you are quoting can not possibly be recorded accuratly or even calucated after the fact because they just did not happen like that. So when comparing lound noises like volcano eruptions and rocket launches you have to take into account how large of a volume they can create that sound in. So you calculate a total energy output instead of a dB number. And the bigger the explosion, the more energy in it, the louder the sound will be at a fixed distance where the sound can actually be measured and make sense.",905

t3_n58bfp,[Star Trek] The Tamarian language can't be translated because it's made entirely of references. How big of a problem is that in other languages?,gwzzx09,"I suspect the issue with Tamarian is not how their metaphors were developed but that the metaphors themselves contain a large amount of information. ""Darmok and Jalad"" is an entire story and referencing it requires that the listener know who Darmok and Jalad were, what they were doing on Tanagra, etc. You don't need to know the etymology of ""guy"" to be able to understand it as ""a person"". It's likely not even as simple as saying ""Two people cooperate against a common enemy and leave as friends"" since it is possible that there are many such stories. At the end of the encounter, we see that ""Picard and Dathon at El-Adrel"" has become a new but different story of mutual cooperation against a common enemy that could be translated in the same way but is clearly distinct. It may even be that ""Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra"" could have multiple meanings, with each use specific to one aspect of the story relevant to the current context. So I think the big challenge is that the language is just plain difficult to translate. The Tamarians think about things very differently than most humanoids and can convey a large amount of information in just a few words. A Universal Translator-style translation of a normal conversation might be equivalent to producing entire lecture series on Tamarian mythology and history. The UT might be able to condense things into something more practical but would lose a large amount of nuance and meaning in the process. In DS9, we see a tiny example of this when the augments are watching a Dominion treaty negotiation and are able to pick up on details from the original Dominionese that the translator could not sufficiently convey. Anything translated from Tamarian would be an extreme version of this.",1742

I’d read the book they were writing about before and remembered it very well, so for a few nights in a row before the paper was due, I’d sneak into his room after our mom went to sleep and would hammer out a rough draft for him to go back and edit the next day so it would sound more like him.

t3_ncdr17,How are blood pressure and heart rate related?,gy4f9bo,"Biologist here! Blood pressure is the amount of force the heart puts out while pumping blood. A weak heart can have a fast beat rate, but the pressure it pumps blood at is weak. A strong heart can have fewer beats, but it pumps so hard that it creates the same pressure of blood flow as a weak heart does. Basically, a strong heart muscle can create more force to move blood, a weak heart can create less pressure, needing more beats. A bad heat can create too much pressure, causing a high pressure in the veins, creating the possiblilty of damage",548

How would Marx himself have responded?",gym0tj2,"My impression is that Marx’s own answer would depend on when it was asked. The early Marx was more prone to a more unilinear teleology. But the late Marx of the 1870’s and 80’s would have answered differently. When asked about the possibility of revolution among the Russian agrarian communes by Vasulich, he stressed that the historical inevitability he mentioned in Capital was limited to Western Europe, and he answered that: “The analysis in Capital therefore provides no reasons-either for or against the vitality of the Russian Commune. But the special study I have made of it, including a search for original source-material, has convinced me that the commune is the fulcrum for social regeneration in Russia.” And in another letter in 1877 on whether or not Russia needed to undergo capitalist development like Western Europe before revolution could occur: “To conclude, as I am not fond of leaving “something to be guessed,” I will come straight to the point. In order that I might be qualified to estimate the economic development in Russia to-day, I learnt Russian and then for many years studied the official publications and others bearing on this subject. I have arrived at this conclusion: If Russia continues to pursue the path she has followed since 1861, she will lose the finest chance ever offered by history to a nation, in order to undergo all the fatal vicissitudes of the capitalist regime.” https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1881/zasulich/reply.htm https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1877/11/russia.htm",1546

t3_nmytdc,What's a great source/book/podcast to read/hear about Anarcho-Communism?,gzs1fyd,"&gt;I wanted to read Kropotkin's Mutual Aid as a preface to the subject but it doesn't seem to be well regarded. I wouldn´t say that this is the case, atleast not amongst Anarchists. The thing with Mutual Aid is that it isn´t a source on Anarchism (the words Anarchy and Anarchism do not appear once in it) but instead more of a work that is meant to debunk certain ideas of human nature, it´s a book on biology rather than Philosophy. That doesn´t mean that the work isn´t important, if one wants to understand Kropotkin then they must also understand his views on human nature etc. to see were he is coming from. Surely many people will disagree with me but I´d say that reading the entire book is not essential (except if you are interest in late 18th-century biology or if you are interested in as many details of Kropotkins works as possible). Reading the Introduction and the Conclusion of the book (You can do that for free [here](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-mutual-aid-a-factor-of-evolution))should suffice to understand the basics of this work. If however you are actually interested in the subject of the book and want a deeper look at it in the historical context I´d also recommend the dissertation [""The struggle for coexistence: Peter Kropotkin and the social ecology of science in Russia, Europe, and England, 1859-1922""](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0378937) by Eric M. Johnson. &gt;Wondering if there is any other place to begin or any other recommended material. For Kropotkins Anarcho-Communism I´d say that [""Anarchist Communism. Its Basis and Principles""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-anarchist-communism-its-basis-and-principles) is probably the best place to start. [""Communism and Anarchy""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-communism-and-anarchy) is also decent. As a book the [""Conquest of Bread""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-the-conquest-of-bread) is usually the go to tho it´s not the best place to start with. Works that focus more on Kropotkins philosophical believes are [""Anarchist Morality""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-anarchist-morality), [""Ethics: Origin and Development""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-ethics-origin-and-development) and [""Modern Science and Anarchism""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-modern-science-and-anarchism). Works not by Kropotkin which are usually considered good introductions to Anarcho-Communism are [""An Anarchist Programme""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/errico-malatesta-an-anarchist-programme), [""Anarchy""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/errico-malatesta-anarchy) and [""At The Café. Conversations on Anarchism""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/errico-malatesta-at-the-cafe) by Errico Malatesta as well as [""What Is Communist Anarchism?""](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/alexander-berkman-what-is-communist-anarchism) by Alexander Berkman. As an aside, Anarchist Youtuber ""Zoe Baker"" has released a video on [""How To Find Anarchist Primary Sources""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zckvdXqkKAk) just a few hours ago which can help you to find more stuff in further researches (She also has an [""Anarchism Reading List""](https://anarchopac.wordpress.com/2013/05/31/recommended-reading/amp/) which you might want to check out).

I have a husband whom I love and I am only interested in concentrating on my duties and don't need to be made to feel unsafe while I'm here"". That may sound cheesy, but honestly, nothing makes a man realize he's being a creep like telling him that he's making you feel unsafe. I've given this same advice to some of my female friends who have had to deal with a creeper before and it works every time. I think the problem is that if you give these kinds of guys an inch, they'll try to take a mile.

Trying to win me back, and make out like everything's fine and let's go out for dinner and blahblahblah. A lot of spin and promises and pretending to care bollocks. It's like a desperate ex crawling back, it's repulsive. He's mentally unstable. And it hurts, it really does. That THIS is my father. It just hurts. This time he also gave me a cheque for £50. I burnt them both as soon as he left. Felt better than binning them (which I did every other time). More of that ""fuck you"" factor.",988
